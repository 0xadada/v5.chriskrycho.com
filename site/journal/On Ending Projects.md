Over the past few years, I’ve [linked to][v4] and [otherwise referred to][ws] Michael Sacasas’ blog fairly often. His public thinking-aloud on matters of technology has been one of my major influences in the same space. As such, I was a bit sad when he [announced][dead] a few weeks ago that he was bringing his blog [The Frailest Thing][tft] to an end.

Sacasas continues to write, but now in [his newsletter, The Convivial Society][tcs]; [^newsletter] and you can find a “best of”-style collection of his blog in ebook form [here][ebook]—free if you choose, but worth a great deal in my opinion. I encourage you to pick it up if you have any interest in tech ethics!)

As I have reflected on this, though, my sadness abated. I remain a *little* sad not to have his blog as an ongoing thing in the world. But I sympathize with him—and as endings go, I like this one. When I wrapped up New Rustacean, I noted that there’s a goodness to ending a thing when it’s done, and not just letting it run on because it *has* been running. Publishing on the internet can make this feel far more difficult: no [edges][edges] inhere in the publication itself.

A book needs to have an ending. Even if the ending is not the text *concluded* so much as merely *stopped*, the physicality of the thing forces a shape to it. Some books sprawl. Some demand inventive work of binding. But all, in the end, have the *edge* that is their *end*. Not so with a blog. It goes on, potentially endless.[^my-posts]

When a thing is done, though, it’s *done*. Recognizing as much is an act of particular maturity. I dare say that Sacasas was able to recognize it in part *because* he had spent a decade learning deeply and reflecting carefully on technology and ethics. He learned, it seems, to sense the edge of a thing even when it is invisible. I’m glad of it—and if I’ll miss his blog, I’m glad he’s [still writing][tcs], and I’ll keep reading as long as he is.

[^newsletter]: Having spent a fair bit of time writing [a newsletter][atss] of my own this year, I understand why he is happy carrying on the newsletter but ending his blog. For all that the two are similar in many ways, they are different, too. More on this in a future post.

[^my-posts]: If you’re thinking that this blog itself, in its various permutations, is an example of such an endlessness… I’m not going to argue with you.
