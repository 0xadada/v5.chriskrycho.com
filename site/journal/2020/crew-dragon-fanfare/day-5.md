    Fighting a horrible mood by making progress anyway. Not much. But enough.

summary: >
    I’m taking a week off… and spending it composing a piece in honor of the upcoming SpaceX crewed test flight—a historic moment. Today, I was borderline depressed, and I barely made progress. But make progress I did.

One thing I *really* wish I knew more about is using getting the full range out of digital instruments. When I listen to the sounds that other composers can pull out of the sound sets that come with [Dorico], it’s extremely apparent that there are profound depths there I simply have *no* idea how to access. (Tutorial links, anyone? I’d be curious!) Digitally-produced music never sounds *quite* like a live recording… but it gets awfully close sometimes, while the recordings I’ve put up this week do *not*.

That’s for another time, though. For now, I’ve contented myself with just making *some* progress on this next section. I had, frankly, a pretty bad day personally today—but I refuse to let that be the final note (no pun intended) for this project, and hammered away at getting some of the ideas I was working with last night and today into Dorico. It’s nothing great, but it’s *something*, and I'll take that.

I would put up the day's materials, but there really isn't almost anything to share. I'm hoping that I'll be able to spend some more time on this tomorrow, and if so I will post what I get to then. Today, it would just be another couple staves of notes in my staff paper notebook, and a few more notes in the score: not enough to really elaborate, or so it feels.

I'm happy with those new notes, though: it took me all day to really start getting to them, but I think I have the key bits I need to keep going, and that's really critical. Not least for my emotional state, which for reasons unrelated to composing took a beating this week! Making forward progress, even on a bad day, is a good thing.
