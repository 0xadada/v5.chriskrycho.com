Welcome to the fifth version of this website! Long-time readers will no doubt notice that it newly has a *title*, as well as a fresh look—albeit one closely connected in many ways to the previous design. Nerds who follow the link to the source of this blog post may notice  What follows are some comments on each of the above!

## 1. New Site Title

For a long time, I did not actually plan to *have* a site title other than “Chris Krycho.” That’s how the previous version of the site was titled, and it worked just fine. However, a few things pushed me to go ahead and add a title to this version.

First, I just kind of *like* sites which have titles. There’s a delightful bit of whimsy to it, and it communicates something interesting about the author. When you come to a website whose title is nothing other than a person’s name, you learn that… you are at the website of a particular person. When you come to a website titled [Irrational Exuberance], or [one][reda] with sections titled “Unredacted” and “Wide Gamut”—well, then you *do* learn something about the author.

Second, a long time ago, on [a previous version of this site][v3], I split the various interests which make up the site into sub-sites with their own titles. The main page was <i>Chris Krycho</i>, but below that lived <i>Designgineering</i>, <i>Ardent Fidelity</i>, <i>Ars Artis</i>, and <i>From the Hearth</i>. I liked the character that added to the site (and I quite enjoyed the art direction I added to give each of those sections its own character), but I ultimately found that there was too much overlap. I could not separate my thoughts on technology from those on art, nor those on art from those on my faith, nor those on my faith from its applications to my work in technology. Accordingly, I pulled those back together when I relaunched the site in 2014. But I miss the interesting titles! So here we are, with an interesting title for the *whole* site!

So about that title!

“Sympolymathesy” is the nerdiest (and therefore most perfect) title imaginable for my site: a Greek-derived neologism extending [someone *else’s* nerdy Greek-derived neologism][symmathesy]. Its three parts are _sym_, together; _poly_, many; _mathesy_, learning.

First of all, I am learning in public, so hopefully you who read and I who write are learning together. Even more so when you [send me an email][email] or trigger a [Webmention] and, by adding your voice to mine, turn my offerings on this site into a conversation.

Second, as I noted [a few years ago][z1], this site has served and will continue to serve as something of a public [Zettelkasten][z2]. A Zettelkasten, as a system of notes that grows organically and helps you derive new connections between ideas over time, is *itself* a sympolymathesy.

Finally, a clarification: “polymath” has the connotations of brilliance about it. I’m not particularly interested in claiming that for myself (the arrogance!). To the contrary, in fact. For one thing _sym_ is the more essential of theese modifiers. For another, I have chosen _-polymathy_, not _polymath_, because this site is for me a way of learning about many things. In no way does it represent the state of being one *already* learned about many things.

## 2. New Site Design

The previous design of my site lasted me for a solid five years, and I quite liked it. However, I increasingly ran into a issues with it—issues that I have run into with *every* design of my website so far. I have many different interests (as suggested by my site title!) and on every previous iteration of the site I attempted to segment my content by *subject*. But while *some* pieces clearly belonged in one category and not another—a post about some TypeScript code was definitely in *Tech* and not *Theology*—a great many of my posts were *not* so easily bracketed. Under which category should I file an essay on a Christian ethic of tech?

The primary mandate for this redesign, then, was to accomodate that variety. I am now sectioning the site by *medium*, instead of by *subject*:

- General blog posts (of whatever length) go in [Journal]
- Essays—actual essays!—go in [Essays]
- Book reviews, quotes, and the like go in [Library]
- Information about my podcasting lives at [Podcasts]
- Photos go under [Photography]
- Ongoing projects, series, etc. will be displayed under [Projects]

As an orthogonal layer of taxonomy over this, I have *tags*. This means I

Once I had started down the road of designing this new information hierarchy, I took the opportunity to rethink the basic navigation and layout of the site. While I liked a lot about the typography of the previous design, it was showing its age. Although I had made some tweaks along the way, I had beeng working with the same underlying structure and layout since [v3], back in 2012!

## 3. New Site Tech

The previous version of the site was built on [Pelican]. This version is built on [Eleventy]. Long-time readers will recall that once upon a time, ages ago (that is: in 2016) I set out to build [my own static site generator][lx]. My aspirations for that project, much deferred, ended up substantially delaying my ultimate work to relaunch this site: because my goal all along was to be able to relaunch using my own tool. That dream is not dead. But it is deferred. I have a lot of thoughts about what a tool in this space can and should look like. Eleventy gets a lot right! It also has a few (significant-to-me) frustrations.
