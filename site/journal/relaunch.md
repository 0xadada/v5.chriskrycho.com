Welcome to <b>Sympolymathesis</b>—the fifth version of this website! I’m happy to have it in the world at last.

Long-time readers will no doubt notice that it newly has a *title*, as well as a fresh look—albeit one closely connected in many ways to the previous design. Curious nerds will also notice that the tech making this thing go has changed. What follows are some comments on each of the above!

1. [New Site Title](#1-new-site-title)
2. [New Site Design](#2-new-site-design)
3. [New Site Tech](#3-new-site-tech)

## 1. New Site Title

“Sympolymathesis”—<span class="greek">συμπολυμαθησις</span>—is a word I made up.[^neologism] It means “learning (_mathesis_) many things (_poly_) together (_sym_).” As a Greek-derived neologism extending [someone *else’s* nerdy Greek-derived neologism][symmathesy], I think it is both the nerdiest title imaginable for my site and therefore also the *best* title imaginable for my site. It is as close I can get as a statement of both the intent of my blogging and what it has been to me for the past fourteen years.[^14] I am learning here—in public, with you.

There are a few layers to this, layers I love. First of all, it matters enormously to me that I am learning in public. When you read and then respond by [sending me an email][email] or triggering a [Webmention][Webmention][^webmention], you help this space be what it is meant to be. Adding your voice to mine—whether in agreement or in disagreement—turns my offerings on this site into a conversation, and therefore something bigger than itself. It becomes a place of learning *together*.

Second, as I noted [a few years ago][z1], my blogging has served and will continue to serve as something of a public [Zettelkasten][z2]. A Zettelkasten, as a system of notes that grows organically and helps you derive new connections between disparate ideas over time, is *itself* a kind of _sympolymathesy_: a thing-which-learns-many-things-together. Thus, both _poly_/many and _sym_/together: _poly_ gets at the variety of ideas and subjects in play, and _sym_ speaks to the connections between those ideas and subject. For that reason, the tag pages on this site will very soon now include a link to that same tag or category on previous versions of the site. This is a relaunch, but it is also a continuation of earlier work.

Finally, a clarification: don't get any weird ideas about the fact that the word "polymath" is embedded in the middle of this bigger word. I am not in the least claiming *that* word's connotations of brilliance—quite the contrary, in fact! This site is for me a way of learning about many things. In no way does it represent the state of being one *already* learned about many things.

### On adding a title at all

For a long time, I did not actually plan to *have* a site title other than “Chris Krycho.” That’s how the previous version of the site was titled, and it worked just fine. However, a few things pushed me to go ahead and add a title to this version.

First, I just kind of *like* sites which have titles. There is—or at least can be—a delightful bit of whimsy to it, and it communicates something interesting about the author. When you come to a website whose title is nothing other than a person’s name, you learn that… you are at the website of a particular person. When you come to a website titled [Irrational Exuberance], or [one][reda] with sections titled “Unredacted” and “Wide Gamut”—well, then you *do* learn something about the author.

Second, a long time ago, on [a previous version of this site][v3], I split the various interests which make up the site into sub-sites with their own titles. The main page was <i>Chris Krycho</i>, but below that lived <i>Designgineering</i>, <i>Ardent Fidelity</i>, <i>Ars Artis</i>, and <i>From the Hearth</i>. I liked the character that added to the site (and I quite enjoyed the art direction I added to give each of those sections its own character), but I ultimately found that there was too much overlap. I could not separate my thoughts on technology from those on art, nor those on art from those on my faith, nor those on my faith from its applications to my work in technology. Accordingly, I pulled those back together when I relaunched the site in 2014. But I miss the interesting titles! So here we are, with an interesting title for the *whole* site!

[^neologism]: I originally went with “a neologism of my own coinage” but what a clunker of a sentence that would have been!

[^webmention]: You know, once I have those set up: soon! It's a fairly high priority for me—but *lower* priority than just getting this out the door!

[^14]: Fourteen! Years! I find it rather astounding that I have been at this so long—longer than any other endeavor in my life.

## 2. New Site Design

The previous design of my site lasted me for a solid five years, and I quite liked it. However, I increasingly ran into issues with it—issues that I have run into with *every* design of my website so far. I have many different interests (as suggested by my site title!) and on every previous iteration of the site I attempted to segment my content by *subject*. But while *some* pieces clearly belonged in one category and not another—a post about some TypeScript code was definitely in *Tech* and not *Theology*—a great many of my posts were *not* so easily bracketed. Under which category should I file an essay on a Christian ethic of tech?

The primary mandate for this redesign, then, was to accommodate that variety. I am now sectioning the site by *medium*, instead of by *subject*:

- General blog posts (of whatever length) go in [Journal](/journal)
- Essays—actual essays!—go in [Essays](/essays)
- Book reviews, quotes, and the like go in [Library](/library)
- Information about my podcasting lives at [Podcasts](/podcasts)
- Photos go under [Photography](/photography)
- Ongoing projects, series, etc. will be displayed under [Projects](/projects)
- I have a dedicated page for speaking, being on other podcasts, etc.: [Appearances](/appearances)

As an orthogonal layer of taxonomy over this, I have *tags*. This means I can still provide ways of sorting through my various subject matter—but overlap is built in. This is an idea I have come to organically by way of my experience with the previous versions of this site, had strongly reinforced by learning about Zettelkasten and reflecting on the design of [rewrite](https://rewrite.software). Even when you *do* have folder-like structures in your projects, you need a way to connect ideas across those. Tags, keywords, topics—call them what you will, you need this tool for structuring the content.

I also have decided that those topical indices will sort the opposite direction from most blog archives (unlike the top-level sections). I have noticed a few times ovee the last few years tha it is quite helpful to be able to follow the development of a person's thoughts. The normal latest-first archive krder of a blog makes sense in many ways—the most recent of a person's thoughts are likely those you are most curious about when first finding your way to their site. Not so much, though, when you want to follow the course their thoughts have taken iver the years! There is more to say here, on the way many of our technologies tend to reinscribe (quite forcefully!) our bent toward recency, and on the unique affordances of blogs as compared to other media, but I will leave those thoughts for another day. The point here is simoly that I am intentionally structuring this site (and may do a small tweak to do the same on v4 as one final act of curation and maintenance for the future!) as a counter to those trends, and in favor of readers' having an easier time following me on the journeys I take.

Once I had started down the road of designing this new information hierarchy, I took the opportunity to rethink the basic navigation and layout of the site. While I liked a lot about the typography of the previous design, it was showing its age. Although I had made some tweaks along the way, I had been working with the same underlying structure and layout since [v3], back in 2012! I still quite like that design—but I like the new look *much* better. It takes many of the same basic elements of typography (including the two main typefaces from [v4]), and tightens them up into something fresh and modern.

## 3. New Site Tech

In the midst of the refresh, I also switched up the ways I'm building and deploying the site.

### Build

The previous version of the site was built on [Pelican]. This version is built on [Eleventy]. Long-time readers will recall that once upon a time, ages ago (that is: in 2016) I set out to build [my own static site generator][lx]. My aspirations for that project, much deferred, ended up substantially delaying my ultimate work to relaunch this site: because my goal all along was to be able to relaunch using my own tool. That dream is not dead. But it is deferred. I have a lot of thoughts about what a tool in this space can and should look like. Eleventy gets a lot right! It also has a few (significant-to-me) frustrations.

I'll cover those more in the future. At this point I'm *satisfied* with Eleventy, and I can make it do the things I need it to. That's more than I've been able to say for Pelican for the last few years! Note that this isn't a criticism of Pelican: it's a perfectly solid tool. The problem is twofold: first, it doesn't *easily* fit certain things I want to do with it; and second, I'm no longer writing Python at all, so hacking on it to make improvements has very little appeal to me. Those are both problems with *me*, though—not Pelican!

As part of this work, I have also invested in some pieces related to the open-source side of Eleventy, which I'll be blogging about more over the coming weeks. Perhaps of particular interest to folks here: I have written TypeScript type definitions for nearly the entire public <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> surface of the project! I also did the work to figure out how to write *all* of an Eleventy configuration in TypeScript. In the meantime, if you're curious, you can just take a look at [the project repo][gh]. Before the end of the year, each post will actually include a direct link to its source on GitHub, along with a "Suggest an edit" link that will allow people to send in corrections for typos and the like.

[Pelican]: https://github.com/getpelican/pelican
[Eleventy]: https://www.11ty.io
[lx]: https://www.github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs
[gh]: https://github.com/chriskrycho/v5.chriskrycho.com

### Deploy

That last bit was always possible in principle on the previous version of the site. However, there were two reasons it wasn't really all that practical:

1. It *required* the person submitting the fix to have a GitHub account. This is not the end of the world, but it meant that I never even bothered to set it up: while some of my readers and potential correctors would already have that, it would just be another hoop to jump through for most. More

2. The build process did not, and unfortunately *could* not, run on any of the normal static site build and deploy tools (like Netlify).[^custom-pelican-setup] Even if someone *did* submit a correction, I had to pull it down to my machine, rebuild, and push it back up to [GitHub Pages][ghp].

I am now not only deploying the site via Netlify, but also *building* it there. That lets me solve both of these quite handily! First of all, the build process is extremely straightforward on Netlify with Eleventy. In the best way, it Just Works™. Second, though, and especially delightfully, Netlify [recently announced][open-authoring] a feature that lets you let *anyone* suggest a change to the site. I don’t have that set up yet, and it’ll probably be a few months… but I’m excited to have the possibility there![^HT]

[ghp]: https://pages.github.com
[open-authoring]: https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/open-authoring/

[^custom-pelican-setup]: I probably could have wrangled a *normal* Pelican setup into building on Netlify, not just deploying there. Unfortunately, [my setup] was not exactly normal: it required having [pandoc] installed along with a custom fork of a non-core plugin, and running all the site content through *that*.

## 4. Onward

I’ve been working on this redesign and reimplementation for over a year. It’s bounced through multiple iterations on both implementation and design. And that’s after thinking about it and sketching ideas for years before that! I’m glad to have it out here, and I’m hopeful that it’ll be a satisfying online home for the *next* half decade. As my friend and longtime collaborator [Stephen] put it as we talked about this design recently: this fresh start opens spaces wide enough to fit all of my work.

So now: time to get down to the business of actually filling up this space with words and photography and more!
