I recently got fed up with my inability to remember the location of specific passages of Scripture. I have a good memory, but it has been failing me here, and the reason why is obvious: easily-accessible digital search. I’m now actively working on *changing* that, because I *want* to be able to remember passages specifically, not just a vague sense of “somewhere in one of Paul’s letters.”

There are a lot of reasons I want that knowledge, including that I need it if I’m going to be licensed to preach, and that I do not in fact *always* have digital search to hand—but the most important of them is: I simply want to know Scripture better.
