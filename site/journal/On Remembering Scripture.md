I recently got fed up with my inability to remember the location of specific passages of Scripture. I have a good memory, but it has been failing me here, and the reason why became very obvious once I started thinking about it: easily-accessible digital search. For years, now, I have had digital Bibles ready to hand ([Accordance], [Logos], [the ESV website], you name it). These are wonderful tools in many ways, and all of them have very functional search engines that make it easy to go from remembering a phrase to reading the passage in moments. I'm grateful!

But. It also means that I simply have not *needed* to exercise my own memory for that task, at all. That means my memory for specific passages has *atrophied*, and sharply. I've outsourced my own mental abilities to the computer.[^outsourcing]

I’m now actively working on *changing* that, because I *want* to be able to remember passages specifically, not just a vague sense of “somewhere in one of Paul’s letters.”

There are a lot of reasons I want that knowledge, including that I need it if I’m going to be licensed to preach, and that I do not in fact *always* have digital search to hand—but the most important of them is: I simply want to know Scripture better.

[^outsourcing]: There is an interesting point to trace out in more detail here, around the difference between computing-as-replacement of human abilities and computing-as-extension of human abilities.
