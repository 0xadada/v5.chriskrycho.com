After spending a year in aperture priority, I finally graduated this evening to manual mode with automatic ISO. It’s lovely. (And [he Sony α7R IV](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm4), which I first tried out via rental exactly a year ago, is still just *the best*.)
