I had the great pleasure of being [the inaugural guest]({{link}}) on Sean Chen’s new podcast, [Humans of Open Source][podcast]. We chatted about all sorts of things around open source software:

- Christian humanism and the big picture of open source as digital infrastructure
- open source “guilt”
- codes of conduct
- working on projects in public
- the tension between open source as a good and making money from projects

If that sounds interesting, [give it a listen]({{link}})! And if you enjoy it, consider subscribe—I for one am quite interested to see where Sean takes the show!
