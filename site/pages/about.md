Since there's enough to get by with on the front page, I assume you're here for the longer version, so… here we go!

If you're trying to figure out what in the world “sympolymathesy” means, I wrote about it [here](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/relaunch!/#1-new-site-title).

## First things first

Self-biographies are a bit weird. No two ways around it. But they *do* give us a chance to think about how we present ourselves to the world. Mine is no different.

The order is careful and the word choice precise. The first things on my personal bio—“a follower of Christ, a husband, and a dad”—are where they are because everything else on the list is both less important than those first three and profoundly informed by them.

### A follower of Christ

The single most important fact of my life is that, to quote [Saint Paul](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+6/): I am not my own, but I was bought with a price—and that price was the death of Jesus Christ, God-the-Son, in my place.[^on-1-cor-6]

[^on-1-cor-6]: Paul was writing specifically about sexual immorality, but the form of his argument is to ground that specific injunction in a very sweeping claim about the Christian life.
