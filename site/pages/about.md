Since there's enough to get by with on the front page, I assume you're here for the longer version, so… here we go!

If you're trying to figure out what in the world “sympolymathesy” means, I wrote about it [here](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/relaunch!/#1-new-site-title).

## First things first

Self-biographies are a bit weird. No two ways around it. But they *do* give us a chance to think about how we present ourselves to the world. Mine is no different.

The order is careful and the word choice precise. The first things on my personal bio—“a follower of Christ, a husband, and a dad”—are where they are because everything else on the list is both less important than those first three and profoundly informed by them.

### A follower of Christ

The single most important fact of my life is that, to quote [Saint Paul](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+6/): I am not my own, but I was bought with a price—and that price was the death of Jesus Christ, God-the-Son, in my place.[^on-1-cor-6]

I am specifically a Christian in the historic Reformed tradition—aiming always to be irenic, catholic, and orthodox. We’re glad members of [Forestgate Presbyterian Church][forestgate] in Northern Colorado Springs, where I serve in various lay leadership roles.

[^on-1-cor-6]: Paul was writing specifically about sexual immorality—but the form of his argument is to ground that specific injunction in a very sweeping, indeed a totalizing, claim about the Christian life.

### A husband and a dad

After following Christ, my family is far and away the most important part of my life. Jaimie and I got married in July 2009, and our daughters Elayne and Kate were born in May 2012 and May 2014.

(This site focuses on my public *thinking*; for occasional family updates see [Not a Hint of Hyperbole](https://krycho.com).)

## By trade: a software engineer

Since graduating college, I have been working more or less full-time in the software industry—starting out writing avionics software and then hazards and risk mitigation software for the energy industry, whiel picking up web development on the side and eventually transitioning into web development full time. You can see my [C.V.](/cv/) for the nitty-gritty professional-historical details! Below are just the salient bits of what I’m doing *right now*.

### LinkedIn

I’m currently a Staff Software Engineer at LinkedIn, working on front-end infrastructure for what most people think of when you say LinkedIn: the app you sign into, send messages and read updates on, etc. I’m currently getting us up to date on the latest version of our core dependency: [Ember.js]. I also regularly work closely with a number of the Ember core team members on design of upcoming features, and since 2017 (well before I joined LinkedIn) I have been one of several people driving forward [TypeScript] adoption in the Ember community.

[TypeScript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org

### Side projects

I am also working on a long-term side project, under the working title [rewrite]. The goal is to build a best-in class <i>research-oriented writing environment</i>—with native and web user interfaces: macOS and iOS and web first, someday hopefully also Windows. See [the website][rewrite] for details and a newsletter for updates along the way!

## By hobby

### A writer

Since college, I have written—primarily on various iterations of chriskrycho.com, but also occasionally at Mere Orthodoxy. I increasingly conceive of my public writing along two axes:

- <i>public theology:</i> both doing theological work *for* the church, and doing theological work *from* the church *for* the world—this is the writing work that I care most about, though it is also the work that is hardest. On this, see more under [By vocation](#by-vocation) below.

- <i>public learning:</i> encouraging a culture of learning by sharing what I’m learning—both so that the things I learn, others gain benefit from, and so that I myself have a good trail to follow in the future!

### A runner

Since 2010, I have been a long-distance runner. A bout of mono left me incredibly weak, and a desire to get back in shape to play [Ultimate] with friends led me to spend a lot of time running over the next year. The running stuck: I *miss* playing Ultimate, but nothing stops me from running regularly. I’ve also completed a super sprint triathlon, and cycle regularly… but running is my favorite.
