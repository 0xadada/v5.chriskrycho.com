Since there's enough to get by with on the front page, I assume you're here for the longer version, so… here we go!

If you're trying to figure out what in the world “sympolymathesy” means, I wrote about it [here](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/relaunch!/#1-new-site-title).

## First things first

Self-biographies are a bit weird. No two ways around it. But they *do* give us a chance to think about how we present ourselves to the world. Mine is no different.

The order is careful and the word choice precise. The first things on my personal bio—“a follower of Christ, a husband, and a dad”—are where they are because everything else on the list is both less important than those first three and profoundly informed by them.

### A follower of Christ

The single most important fact of my life is that, to quote [Saint Paul](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+6/): I am not my own, but I was bought with a price—and that price was the death of Jesus Christ, God-the-Son, in my place.[^on-1-cor-6]

I am specifically a Christian in the historic Reformed tradition—aiming always to be irenic, catholic, and orthodox. We’re glad members of [Forestgate Presbyterian Church][forestgate] in Northern Colorado Springs, where I serve in various lay leadership roles.

### A husband and a dad

<!-- TODO: picture of family -->

After following Christ, my family is far and away the most important part of my life. Jaimie and I got married in July 2009, and our daughters Elayne and Kate were born in May 2012 and May 2014.

(This site focuses on my public *thinking*; for occasional family updates see [Not a Hint of Hyperbole](https://krycho.com).)

[^on-1-cor-6]: Paul was writing specifically about sexual immorality—but the form of his argument is to ground that specific injunction in a very sweeping, indeed a totalizing, claim about the Christian life.
