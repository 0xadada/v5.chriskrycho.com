## Implementation

I built this version of the site with [Eleventy]. You can find the entirety of the implementation (and indeed the entire *history* of the implementation) [on GitHub][repo]. I'm using it with the following plugins:

- <b>typeset:</b> my own implementation of a plugin for [typeset], heavily inspired by [eleventy-plugin-typeset].

- <b>[markdown-it] plugins:</b>
    - [anchor](https://github.com/valeriangalliat/markdown-it-anchor)
    - [definition list](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-deflist)
    - [footnote](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-footnote)
    - [superscript](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-sup)

- <b>spacewell:</b> a little tool I built a few years ago to insert hair spaces around em dashes and thin spaces with non-breaking spans around number-separating en dashes; the source is colocated with the rest of the site.

## Typography

| Context  | Typeface |
| -------- | -------- |
| Body text | [Sabon], designed by Jan Tschichold in the mid-1960s as a Garamond revival. In my opinion, the most beautiful Garamond in existence. Licensed via [Fonts.com]. |
| Headings  | [Cronos], designed by Robert Slimbach in 1996. A nice contrast to Sabon with its digital-era roots. The typeface I’ve been using on my site the longest at this point! Licensed via [Fonts.com]. |
| Code      | [Hack], designed by Chris Simpkins in 2015 as an extension of the Deja Vu/Bitstream Vera lineage. Licensed in parts under the MIT License, the public domain, and Bitstream Vera License (see details [here][hack-license]). |

## Inspiration

While working on this design, I took more-or-less-direct inspiration in a variety of ways from some of my favorite current or previous designs around the web:

- [Tim Brown](https://tbrown.org)
* [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com)
- [Trent Walton](https://trentwalton.com)
- [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com)—a truly wonderful site, but I actually loved the *previous* design iteration even more.
- [Jen Simmons](https://jensimmons.com)—as with Mod’s current site, I really like what she’s doing on her site now—it’s all sorts of fun layout-wise—but it’s quite distinct from what she was doing when I was stealing ideas from her late in 2018!
