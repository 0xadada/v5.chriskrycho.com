I try to keep this page fairly current; I last updated it on {% localeDate page.date, 'MMMM d, yyyy' %}. A few notes on the way this is organized and presented:

- In the “Completed” section and for previous years, entries appear in the order I finished the books.
- Previous years only include books from years where I actually know what I read!
- Books are marked “(new)” if this was the first time I read them, or “(reread)” otherwise.
- I separate out fiction and non-fiction not because I value them differently, but because they just *are* very different.
- Links on the books themselves are affiliate links to Alibris!
