In addition to posting reviews of Christian books, it is my intent to
post a review or response of *every* book that I read for the first time
henceforth. As I noted in my launch post, I think it will be helpful to
me in processing the contents of the books I read.

One consequence of this will be my reviewing a great number of books
that are not explicitly Christian. I think these may actually prove to
be the more interesting reviews and responses in some ways, as they will
afford an opportunity to think more critically and synthetically about
the world. It is an unfortunate reality that most (modern) Christian
books are not nearly as penetratingly engaging with the world as they
should be, and so I often find that the books that challenge me most to
think Christianly about the world are, while not usually opposed to
Christianity, also often rather disinterested in it.

In any case, I look forward to seeing what I learn from reviewing
non-theological books from an explicitly (and, hopefully, robustly)
theological framework. I expect the first such volume I respond to to be
[Thomas Friedman's <cite>The World is Flat</cite>][], which I hope to
finish within the next week or so.
