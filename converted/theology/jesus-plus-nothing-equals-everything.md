*From time to time I'll be writing book *responses*, like this one -
shorter than my formal reviews, and more a quick snapshot of my thoughts
in response to the book than a careful dissection of the work.*

Tullian Tchividjian's[1][] <cite>Jesus + Nothing = Everything</cite>
was, in one sense, a great book. In another, it was just okay.

![Jesus + Nothing = Everything cover][]

It was a great book in its glorious exposition of what Matt Chandler
might call the on-the-ground view of the gospel: Jesus' life, death, and
resurrection, applied to the individual's life. Tchividjian, like many
others who have written in this gospel-centered movement over the last
few years, said little about the cosmic kingdom aspects of the gospel.
But that's okay: Tchividjian's target is not a definition of the gospel,
but to ask how sanctification happens.

Taking his cues from Colossians, Tchividjian traces out how Jesus' work
on our behalf is all-sufficient for our spiritual needs and the soul
source of power for our spiritual lives. I enjoyed his clear passion for
the gospel and his constant return to the glory of not only the cross,
but also Jesus' life and his resurrection. These parts of the books -
including the forward-looking conclusion, a meditation on the final
fulfillment of all Christ's work in us in the new heavens and the new
earth - were a good reminder. Best of all, they made me want to go
reread Colossians; it's hard to pay a book a higher compliment than to
say that it made you want to read the word of God yourself all the more.

However, throughout the book I had a constant niggling sense of mild
disagreement. Tchividjian argues in what seems, after a while, almost
[Higher Life][]-style in its approach to sanctification. I say almost:
at no point did I think, "That's just wrong!" Tchividjian never quite
embraces the Higher Life "Let go and let God" idea. But he's close,
often enough, and it niggled at me. He argues throughout the book that
the enemy of the gospel is always legalism, and that what we call
"license" is really just another form of legalism. This definition
doesn't seem to add up to me, and it also doesn't quite seem to do
justice to Paul's argument in Romans especially.

Where Tchividjian has a tendency to set work and gospel in opposition to
each other - constantly emphasizing that sanctification is a result of
growing in the knowledge of God, *not* of our efforts - I would say that
the two are so tightly entangled in sanctification that we cannot
separate them. Peter and Paul and John all make a point to found every
imperative on the gospel; this far Tchividjian is exactly on target. But
the books are full of imperatives, and these are imperatives that
Christians are to actively pursue. The pursuit is never for its own
sake, and never without grounding in the gospel, and never apart from
the power of Christ dwelling in us. Yet we are called to *work* in
precisely the same passages that the apostles clearly say that it is God
who works in us. This is no place, in other words for negation.

Similarly, Paul's answer to license is, "Stop! Don't you see that the
gospel orients you in another direction?" The gospel is there, and it's
central, and it's absolutely necessary - but there's also the command to
stop! Christians are called to be active participants in our
sanctification.

Tchividjian gets this, and he notes as much at a couple points - but I
wish he didn't so often set gospel and effort as opposed to each other.
Christians are called to effort, but effort empowered by, buttressed by,
saturated by, and in every way shaped and informed by the gospel. There
is no antithesis.

I'm hardly the first to bring up this line of disagreement. Tchividjian
and Kevin DeYoung have carried on a spirited, irenic,
iron-sharpening-iron [discussion][] over at The Gospel Coalition over
the last year, and just a couple days ago, D. A. Carson weighed in with
what I thought were some [helpful pastoral words][] on the subject:

> So in a church that has lots and lots and lots of moralism in it, you
> need to see the comprehensiveness of the gospel. That's what needs to
> be applied to the church. But once you start getting a whole lot of
> people who really do understand something of grace, but they're
> beginning to sink in lethargy, into a comfortable acceptance of grace
> without understanding that grace has entailments in terms of obedience
> and striving, then it becomes urgent to pass on those sorts of
> emphases too, while still avoiding the do, do, do of just mere
> moralism.

Read all of those posts; they're worth your time. And also, read
[<cite>Jesus + Nothing = Everything</cite>][]. It's a good book, and
worth your time for the gospel meditations alone. Go buy a copy and read
it; even if you disagree with a few of Tchividjian's particulars, you
won't be able to avoid being blessed by the whole. We can all of us
always use more gospel, more whole-hearted and full-throated exultation
in the glory of what Christ has done for us.
