> Were we to attempt to go over the whole subject [of the divine
> perfections in the creation of the world] we should never come to a
> conclusion, there being as many miracles of divine power, as many
> striking evidences of wisdom and goodness, as there are classes of
> objects, nay as there are individual objects, great or small,
> throughout the universe.

â€”John Calvin, <cite>Institutes of the Christian Religion</cite>
