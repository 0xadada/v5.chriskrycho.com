Over at The Pangea Blog, Kurt Willems offers some [provocative
thoughts][] on Chris Tomlin’s “Our God is Greater”:

> I agree with every line of this song. Nothing about it is
> theologically untrue in any way. But I think that singing “Our God is
> Greater” **might** make God seem less great….
>
> To call God “great” is more than appropriate, but calling God
> “greater” invites a competitive and confrontational tone. So, in this
> sort of cultural climate, I make the claim that singing songs about
> how “our God is greater” actually makes God less great. Two reasons
> come to mind as to why this **might** be so.

The two reasons Willems proffers are: first, that it essentially
proclaims that the Christian narrative should be central to society – a
stance he clearly sees as imperialist and which he conflates with
American nationalism; and second, that the proclamation of God as
greater may be offensive, especially in an increasingly pluralistic and
post-Christian culture.

I should note, right off the bat, that Willems thinks the theology of
the song perfectly accurate (and says as much explicitly). More, I
believe he is coming from the right direction as he approaches this
question: he wants to make sure that God is *most* glorified and that
people are drawn to him. We couldn’t agree more on those aims, but we
differ quite a bit on whether this song, and the sentiments it
expresses, will be salutary or detrimental in the pursuit of those
goals.<!--more-->

Willems cites a number of transitions that take place as a society
transitions from “Christendom” to “post-Christendom”:

-   From the center to the margins: in Christendom the Christian story
    and the churches were central, but in post-Christendom these are
    marginal.
-   From the majority to the minority: in Christendom Christians
    comprised the (often overwhelming) majority, but in post-Christendom
    we are a minority.
-   From settlers to sojourners: in Christendom Christians felt at home
    in a culture shaped by their story, but in post-Christendom we are
    aliens, exiles and pilgrims in a culture where we no longer feel at
    home.
-   From privilege to plurality: in Christendom Christians enjoyed many
    privileges, but in post-Christendom we are one community among many
    in a plural society.
-   From control to witness: in Christendom churches could exert control
    over society, but in post-Christendom we exercise influence only
    through witnessing to our story and its implications.
-   From maintenance to mission: in Christendom the emphasis was on
    maintaining a supposedly Christian status quo, but in
    post-Christendom it is on mission within a contested environment.
-   From institution to movement: in Christendom churches operated
    mainly in institutional mode, but in post-Christendom we must become
    again a Christian movement.

I think he is right about these transitions, and with him I actually
welcome these transitions. But the conclusions he draws are, in my view,
deeply flawed.

First, he argues that the tone of the song is too confrontational: that
call God not only “great” but “greater” sounds like a power play: “my
dad can beat up your dad.” But this is just the sort of declaration that
populates every book of the Bible: that God is *greater* than every
other god, indeed, than every other thing that lays claim on our hearts.
We cannot hesitate to say as much today. This truth is not ours to mute
when it becomes culturally unacceptable; it is not ours to decide what
aspects of God ought to be in the forefront. Scripture is clear, and our
responsibility is to Sripture, not to the changing whims of the world.

Willems wants to say that the church cannot say this from the margins
now (though it did in its beginning) because our history is different.
We have occupied a position of power, and accordingly, this song sends a
message about cultural dominance. But as with all points of theology apt
to be misunderstood, our responsibility is not to mute the teaching but
to explicate it more clearly.

Further, Christianity should not seek to be the central narrative in
society, he thinks. But of course, if Christianity is true, then
Christians should want it to be the central narrative in every
individual’s life – and if it is the central narrative in most lives in
a culture (admittedly a far cry from today’s situation), then it *will*
be the central narrative of the culture. Christianity stood as the
central narrative of culture not because of mere power-mongering but
because it triumphed over every competing narrative for centuries.

This, then, is not a matter of political power plays, but of passion for
the gospel. In the end, every knee *will* bow and every tongue *will*
confess that Jesus is Lord. Not that he’s nice, not that he’s
fascinating, not even that he is Savior – that he is *Lord*.

We dare not truncate our proclamation of the character of God for any
reason. In a generation that cares far more about social justice and
equality than about sin, that embraces a certain egalitarian approach to
all religions (“Whatever works for you, man”), the declaration of God as
triumphant is *more* essential, not less. Truth always offends. Which
apsect of God’s self-revelation offends most varies age to age, and the
temptation is ever-present to compromise on just those points where our
culture stands most opposed to what God has said. We must not.

More: though Willems seems to think offending the outsider with this
sort of confrontational language will prevent people from coming to God,
I believe just the opposite is true. What is needed in this time is not
agreement, even tacit, with the compromising spirit of the age, but
prophetic declaration of truth. We claim to love speaking truth to
power. Well, then: let us do just that. People will be won by the Spirit
of God in the clear proclamation of the gospel, as they ever have been.
And part of the gospel is that God is greater than every other power in
the world. Not merely great, but greatest – he brooks no rivals; he is
the *king*. That’s good news precisely because of the rest of the
gospel: his triumph over sin, his redemption of people to live in
righteousness. But it is good news.

Willems is wrong for another reason, too: he misses the fundamental
breach between church and culture – an ironic failure for an Anabaptist.
Even were we to grant that the song’s tone is inappropriate for cultural
interaction and engagement, that it is too hostile seemeing for
outsiders, this would still not be grounds for ceasing to sing it in the
congregation. The church stands apart from culture, its members in the
world but not of it. Our worship *must* reflect that difference. The
corporate worship of a gonregation is not \_for\_outsiders but for God
himself first and then for the edification of the community of
believers. That outsiders might be offended or turned off by our
declaration of truth in worship is utterly irrelevant. Indeed: if no
part of our worship offends a non-believer, we are almost certainly not
worshipping the true God.

“Our God is Greater” is precisely the sort of song we should be singing
more: it exalts God and instructs believers. It confronts the lies of
this age and boldly declares God’s supremacy over all things. The moment
we bend knee to our culture’s theological egalitarianism is the moment
we begin to compromise on the very nature of God himself.

No impulse, however noble, can carry us down that road without great
harm. We either stand firm on what is theologically true – without
hesitation, without qualification – or we risk losing the very thing we
aim at. Whenever Christians have turned from proclaiming *all* truth
about God, the gospel inevitably becomes murky. This is just as much the
case for those who proclaim God’s sovereignty without proclaiming his
love (the pit into which my own camp is likely to fall) as it is for
those who want to proclaim his love without his lordship. We need both,
and we need to proclaim them boldly.

There is more to be said, here, of course: his association of the song
with American nationalism is perplexing at best. I suspect he's reading
into the song meaning that no Christian I know attaches to it, probably
thanks to his *other* Anabaptist and progressive views. But almost 1500
words is enough for one night.

Let me close by reiterating that I think Willem’s aims are dead on. May
God indeed be more glorified in the church in America. May his
church-planting efforts be fruitful for the transformation of many lives
as he preaches the gospel. May we, like him, be *more* concerned, not
less, with the plight of our unbelieveing neighbors and friends. But let
us not, in pursuing those things, even begin to mute any part of our
proclamation. Those unbelieving neighbors need *all* the truth about
God, not only the parts that they like, and not only the parts that are
less historically and culturally fraught.
