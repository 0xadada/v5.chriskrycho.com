> The best way for a white church to serve alongside black pastors is to
> first think of themselves in a subordinate role—to first listen to
> what black pastors say the needs are and then to submit to black
> pastoral leadership. Far too often white churches approach black
> pastors assuming they know what is best for communities in which they
> do not live and for people they do not know. It is the same posture
> that is needed in international missions: Americans go to other
> countries and follow the lead of people who are there on the ground.
> Cross-cultural relationships in America are not different. This
> posture of humility will yield amazing dividends for the Kingdom.
