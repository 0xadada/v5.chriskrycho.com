> [The Southern Baptist] convention built its legacy on reaching white
> people. But we’ve got to do whatever it takes to change this legacy.
> The gospel demands that we do so. God the Father sacrificed his son to
> reach the diverse peoples and tribes, and to bring them into gospel
> unity. As the USA becomes increasingly diverse, our all-white churches
> increasingly appear as a contradiction to the gospel. If we are not
> careful, public perception will be along these lines, “If you want
> racial integration and unity, rely on the US government. But if you
> want all-white gatherings that are bizarre anomalies in a diverse
> culture, go to a SBC church.”
