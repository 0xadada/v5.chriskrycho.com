Barnabas Mam knows the love of God. That's it, plain and simple.

Of course, there is more to it: the story of the Cambodian church in the
years of the Killing Fields and the refugee era that followed is complex
and sometimes horrifying. Nonetheless, that single theme comes through:
Barnabas Mam knew the love of God in the most frightening, dangerous
situations imaginable. That love in turn empowered him to pour out his
life for his fellow Cambodians, that they, too, might know the power of
the gospel. <!--more-->

> "Yet" is the geographical fixed point for the follower of Christ. It

> My life isn't the only one that has a resounding "yet" at it's center.
> You'll find *yet* over and over in the Psalms...

Barnabas Mam was a nominal Buddhist, then a committed Communist, then -
and now - a devout Christian. His story in [<cite>Church Behind the
Wire: A Story of FAITH in the Killing Fields</cite>][] highlights the
power of God to change hard hearts and to work through remarkable
suffering, and the Cambodian experience of the last four decades is a
profound illustration of Tertullian's maxim that "the blood of the
martyrs is the seed of the church."

There are enormous lessons here for a Western church often caught up in
the American dream of wealth and comfort and ease, for an evangelical
culture that sees apathy or dislike as "persecution," and for believers
who think of Jesus primarily in terms of personal fulfillment. The
American church has not known persecution; Christians here have not
known even societal condemnation, much less massacre. Rare is the
believer who has faced anything worse than veiled scorn for his beliefs
- and depending on which part of the country one lives in, the scorn
might be flowing the other direction.

Yet Barnabas Mam isn't delivering a critique of Western Christianity,
though he does comment on some of our oddities occasionally. He is
telling the story of God's goodness in the midst of horrors we can only
grasp. If his proclamation of God's faithfulness in the face of real
threats is convicting and challenging, that speaks to our faltering, not
his message. Again: the book is oriented on a simple theme: that God is
good, and his love is always with us.

Because Mam hews closely to this theme, the book isn't merely
challenging; it is thoroughly encouraging. It is apparent that the
gospel - the *good news* - of Jesus Christ has profoundly shaped his
life, and so the gospel shapes the book, and so this book reminded me to
look again and again at the great love of God revealed in Jesus Christ.
Reading turned my heart to worship more than once. How many memoirs can
make *that* claim? In a day overflowing with memoirs, this one stands
out, because Mam has no interest in making himself look good. His
weaknesses, sins, and failures are writ large on these pages. But God's
grace, favor, goodness, and miraculous power are writ even larger.

Here, too, are good reminders for the Western church, especially the
more cerebral types. (I'm looking squarely at my own Reformed cohort in
particular, here.) The reality of God's present activity in the world
couldn't be more apparent in Mam's story. Prayers answered, provision
made, protection given - this is God in the now, presently working in
the lives of his people in ways that we ought not hesitate to describe
as miraculous. We need to hear this, as a people who often
intellectually affirm God's power but rarely pray as though he will
actually *do* things. Intellectual assent to great truths is important -
but if that assent does not carry through into our prayers and our
choices, it is ultimately meaningless.

The other side of that coin is the reality that Barnabas Mam and his
people were praying not only for personal comfort, but for real change
in hard hearts and a broken nation. They prayed not only with the
expectation that God could move, but with much greater aims in mind than
ours. We content ourselves with prayers for God to make our comfortable
lives even more comfortable, to remove even the hint of suffering. They
prayed for God to *use* their suffering (as well as to save them from
it), and for their people and nation to recognize his goodness. The
fruit was and is flourishing churches and slow but real healing of deep,
deep scars. Again, Mam's story challenges us to examine our priorities
and the aims of our prayers. Do we put the advance of the gospel front
and center practically as well as verbally, or do we allow ourselves to
be distracted by other ends?

The book wasn't without its occasional missteps. It's clear that Mam has
little time for "high-sounding theology" (his phrase), and he several
times sets theological clarity *against* deep fellowship. The value of
right doctrine, it becomes clear late in the book, has been a painful
lesson for the Cambodian church to learn, as it now battles against
cultism operating in the name of Christianity. I certainly share his
high value for unity among God's people, but where he sees these
elements of the faith in opposition, I see them complementing one
another. I would love for him to value truth - which many believers have
bought with a price just as great as that the Cambodians paid for their
fellowship - just as much as I wish my Reformed friends valued real
unity over theological *nitpicking*.

On the whole, though, I really enjoyed the book. Mam, it is clear,
*really* loves Jesus, and the gospel has shaped his entire adult life -
and through him, many thousands of believers in Cambodia. Praise God!
Would that we all held the gospel so dear and knew it so clearly. Kitty
Murray, Mam's coauthor, deserves some serious commendation as well: this
book was *exceptionally* well-written, with some really beautiful and
powerful turns of phrase throughout.

I will leave you with the marvelous thought with which Mam and Murray
close the book (and encourage you to [read it for yourself][<cite>Church

> *This* is what it means to be home.
