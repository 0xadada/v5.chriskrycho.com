Our faces bear the marks of the way we have lived - a point made well by
Matt Anderson in <cite>Earthen Vessels</cite>, and which even Wordsworth
knew. Something worth keeping in mind as we live: even our faces will
show (or not) our love of God and man.

> But we are often pressed by heavy laws,  
>  And often, glad no more,  
>  We wear a face of joy, because  
>  We have been glad of yore

â€”"The Fountain: A Conversation," William Wordsworth, <cite>Selected
Poems</cite>
