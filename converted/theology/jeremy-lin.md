The internet has been abuzz these past few weeks about another new
Christian athlete suddenly making headlines. This fall saw "Tebowmania,"
and now we have "Linsanity," as Jeremy Lin shows remarkable talent on
the basketball court. I'm not really a basketball fan, but I *am* a fan
of the way both Tebow and now Lin seem to see their [vocation][]: as an
opportunity to glorify God, whatever the outcome of their games (HT:
[Stephen Carradini][]).
