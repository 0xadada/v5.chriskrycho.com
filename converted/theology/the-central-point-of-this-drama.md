> The central point of this drama is the God who shows favor, the God
> who walked with many of my brothers and sisters through the valley of
> the shadow of death and led them to a different destination from mine.
> They are now in His presence. They do not need the hope or the faith
> of which my story speaks. That's because, when all is gone, God
> remains—and what we'll see of Him most clearly in that day is His
> love.

—Barnabas Mam with Kitty Murray, <cite>Church Behind the Wire</cite>
