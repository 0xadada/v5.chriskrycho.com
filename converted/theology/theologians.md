None of us form our theology in a vacuum; all of us are indebted both to
those who have gone before and those who provoke us in the present
tense. These blogs most challenge and encourage me in following Christ.

<div class="column left donthyphenate">
### Outstandingly insightful

-   [Blog and Mablog][] – Doug Wilson is 94% brilliant and 6% crazy.
    Just ignore the crazy.
-   [Christian Thought and Tradition][] – Nathan Finn is a professor of
    church history, and as smart as they come.
-   [Cranach][] – Gene Veith on politics and culture from a Lutheran
    perspective.
-   [Evangel][] – a robust mix: I often disagree but always think hard.
-   [The Gospel Driven Church][] – Jared Wilson is on-point and
    incisively gospel-centric.
-   [Mere Orthodoxy][] – Matthew Anderson and a brilliant team of young
    thinkers. (And me, too.)
-   [Reformation21][] – Carl Trueman and a few more really smart
    Presbyterians.

### Missionaries

-   [David and Kristia Abbot][] – serving in the Philippines with New
    Tribes Missions.
-   [ParadoxUganda][] – the Drs. Scott and Jennifer Myhre on medical
    mission in Kijabe, Kenya.
-   [the traveling russells][] – Chase and Julie Russell, working in
    children's ministry in Nicaragua
-   [Tom and Danielle Brendle][] – equipping outbound missionaries after
    serving the Siawi people of Papua New Guinea with New Tribes.

### Aggregators

-   [Justin Taylor][] – the best aggregator of Christian content on the
    web.
-   [Challies Dot Com][] – Tim Challies writes articles, too, but I find
    his *A La Carte* lists most interesting.
-   [Kingdom People][] – Trevin Wax's daily *Worth a Look* and weekly
    *Trevin's Seven* selections are always informative.

### Church

-   [9Marks Blog][] – Mark Dever and his team's ministry on building
    healthy churches.
-   [Ed Stetzer][] – a church-planter and missiologist whose posts are
    always provocative.
-   [Practical Shepherding][] – Brian Croft shares insights on pastoral
    practice.
-   [Pure Church][] – Thabiti Anyabwile (pronounce that!) is
    consistently thoughtful.
-   [Pillar on the Rock][] – a shameless plug for the group blog I
    contribute to and edit.

    good writer.
-   [Studies and Reflections on God's Glory in Christ][] – Tyler Cowden
    is slowly fleshing out a robust personal theology.

### Theology & practice

    Theological Seminary. Wide-ranging and helpful.

    on book reviews.

    best voices on Christ-centered, doctrinally sound living.

    joy.

    technology.
-   [Euangelion][] – a bit more "moderate" theological positions and
    nonetheless helpful.
-   [The Gospel Coalition Blog][] – a very active blog with commentary
    on Christian living.
-   [Joshua Harris][] – he kissed dating goodbye, and eventually said
    hello to pastoral ministry.
-   [The Scriptorium Daily][] – professors at the Torrey Honors
    Institute at Biola on art, culture, politics and theology.</a>
-   [Steven A. McKinion][] – a professor at Southeastern Baptist, now
    walking through his son's fight with cancer.

    and gospel-powered life.
