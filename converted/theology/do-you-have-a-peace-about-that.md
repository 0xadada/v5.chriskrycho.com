You need to make a difficult decision, and ask Christian friends for
their input. They give some advice, then ask, "Do you have a peace about
your decision?"

<!--more-->You're having a difficult time working through something, and
after someone prays for you, they want to know if you're sensing God's
assurance, and ask, "Do you have a peace, now?"

You've just confronted a brother or sister about their sin, and aren't
sure how well the conversation went. To comfort you, a friend asks,
"Well, do you have a peace about what you did?"

*Do you have a peace about that?* Or, to put it in more explicitly
theological terms, has the Holy Spirit supernaturally imparted a unique,
subjective sense of assurance about a given subject?

### When the rubber meets the road

I've heard this phrase all my life. Somewhere in the last five years, it
began to grate on me. I've sat quietly on this one for a while; I don't
want to become simply a pious doctrinaire who, like the grammar-hounds
always nitpicking at people's English, is always highlighting every
minor theological imprecision in people's language. However, I *do*
believe that [our words matter][], and I am a bit perplexed by this
particular phrase.

The phrase is extra-biblical, of course. That's not necessarily a
problem in and of itself; we have a great deal of verbiage that is
extra-biblical, including in some important cases of orthodoxy. Much of
our language for the Trinity, for example, is extra-biblical, from the
word "Trinity" to our technical terms ("essence," "person,"
"subsistence," "substance," etc.). Being extra-biblical is no indictment
of a phrase. When the phrase is an common part of our Christian idiom,
however, we ought to make sure it is biblical in its sentiments even if
not in its wording.

And here the tires begin to squeal a bit. I suspect the idea is drawn
from passages like Philippians 4:6-7 or Isaiah 26:3, both of which
promise peace to those who trust in God. We can hardly say, then, that
God does *not* offer peace to believers. Clearly, he does! However, the
application so many well-intended believers seem to be drawing from
these passages is strangely absent from the rest of Scripture if indeed
it is their intended meaning. I cannot find a single instance of someone
making a decision or trusting more in God because of a subjective sense
of peace imparted to his heart by the Holy Spirit - not one.

### The other way around {#other-way-around}

Perhaps we ought therefore to ask: what does it matter if you "have a
peace" about something? Does Scripture give us grounds to believe that
subjective experiences of peace are a means by which the Spirit speaks?

Consider: Paul writes of himself as constantly in danger, as persecuted
and resisted wherever he goes. You would think, then, that if a
subjective sense of peace granted by the Holy Spirit were a part of his
decision-making or assurance, it would appear in his writing or in
Luke's narratives in Acts. It does not. When Paul describes his
apostolic hardships, describing his ministry to the doubting Corinthian
church, he writes:

> We put no obstacle in anyone's way, so that no fault may be found with
> our ministry, but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every
> way: by great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities,
> beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger; by
> purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love;
> by truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of
> righteousness for the right hand and for the left; through honor and
> dishonor, through slander and praise. We are treated as impostors, and
> yet are true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we
> live; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always
> rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet
> possessing everything. (2 Corinthians 6:3-10)

Note that of all the points Paul lays out, "a peace" does not make the
list. You will find the same to be true throughout Scripture.

David was often in anguish, calling out for God to save him. Never does
he mention subjective experiences of peace in guiding his decisions. Nor
does "a peace" assure him of God's faithfulness, or that circumstances
will work to his favor. Likewise, Jeremiah's righteous prayers for
relief went apparently unanswered, his hopes for his countrymen were
dashed on the rocks of the Babylonian invasion, and his obedience to God
netted him only suffering. Read of his faithfulness in Jeremiah and his
sorrow in the pages of Lamentations; you will find no trace of "a peace"
- only trust in God's righteous faithfulness.

Indeed, it is the other way around. Throughout Scripture, as in
<cite class="bibleref" title="Philippians 4:6-7">Philippians</cite> and
<cite class="bibleref" title="Isaiah 26:3">Isaiah</cite>, peace is not
the ground of the believer's assurance, but the result of his trust. Our
subjective experience of peace tells us one thing and one glorious thing
only: *God is with us*. David did not have peace because God wanted him
to know that he was doing the right thing; rather, he could rest in
peace because he trusted God's protection and believed his promises
(Psalm 4:8; see the <cite class="bibleref" title="Psalm 4">rest of the
psalm</cite> for the broader picture).

### A better peace

I recognize that this view butts up against many of our deeply held
views and against experiences we may cherish. However, we are called to
submit to the authority of Scripture. If Scripture gives us no reason to
look for "a peace" as confirmation of right action, prayer, or hopes, we
should look for no such thing.

Do not mistake me: I am not arguing that we do not at times enjoy a
supernatural experience of peace. The Holy Spirit does sometimes grant
us unique tastes of his presence. However, these are *not* measures of
our faithfulness or the rightness of our walk with God. Nor are they
indicative of whether we are making the right decision, or of how our
present circumstances will turn out in the end.

We will experience fear and courage, sorrow and joy, loneliness and
hope, and in all of these we may know God's peace. We will make poor
decisions and good decisions, pray in line with God's will and not, see
our hopes met and our hopes dashed, and in all of these we may know
God's peace. Thank God - what miserable people we would be if God's
peace were dependent on us or our circumstances! We are called to do one
thing and one thing only: trust God.

This is a *good* thing. When we rely on these subjective impressions, we
can easily become distraught if we are *not* experiencing the peace we
associate with God's favor. We begin to question whether we are walking
in God's will, or to wonder whether something is going wrong that we
don't know about, or whether we prayed the wrong thing. On the other
hand, when we recognize that God's peace is freely available to whomever
trusts in him, we are freed from the tyranny of experience. We can rest
completely in his goodness. We may trust that whatever comes, whatever
we have done, and however we have prayed, he is working all things for
good, and he will fulfill his promises. We can trust in him and rely on
his character, regardless of what we feel. Would that we were all so
free.
