> Faith is not a private reality that arises from inner reflection or as
> a result of philosophical investigation. People receive the Spirit "by
> hearing with faith" (Galatians 3:2-5). When human beings hear the word
> of the gospel and believe, they are saved. The oral proclamation of
> the word is necessary for faith.

â€”Thomas R. Schreiner, <cite>Paul, Apostle of God's Glory in
Christ</cite>
