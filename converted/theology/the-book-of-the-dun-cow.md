Good and evil, long at war; the feeble things of this world chosen to
confound the great and the foolish to confound the wise; God in his
heaven and the great enemy coming against his creatures; the horrid lure
of sin and the beautiful agony of faithfulness; the sorrow of loneliness
and the sweet ache of love; the agonizing distance of God in trouble and
his provision of bewildering aid - these all writ large in the lives of
simple animals. This is <cite>The Book of the Dun Cow</cite>.

I had never heard of Walter Wangerin Jr. until Kevin DeYoung
[recommended][] this book at the end of last year. I now intend to read
every book in Wangerin's oeuvre. This book was that good.

Wangerin is a good writer. His prose may surprise you, though; it is
old-fashioned. Not in the sense of difficult-to-follow, but rather in
the way it rejects the journalistic prose so fashionable in most modern
fiction. He is not wordy or pedantic; it is just that he is enchanted
with words, and seems determined in the best way to enchant the reader
with them, too. The narrative voice is perhaps the most surprising:
Wangerin happily employs an omniscient third person narrator, and does
it well.

The plot is simple and the characters equally so, at least at first
blush. As the pages unfold, though, both plot and characters unveil
considerable resonance and depth. The characters remain simple, but they
are neither flat nor static. Likewise, the plot is never complex, but it
takes shape as something more akin to mythology than mere adventure.

Though Wangerin is writing in a genre near that of Lewis' <cite>The
Chronicles of Narnia</cite>, with his talking animals and fantastical
world, the kinship with Tolkien is equally apparent. There is an
intentional sense of mythic proportion to the events as they unfold. The
omniscient narrator, the soaring language, the clearly explained
antiquity of the setting: all evoke that same sense of ancient grandeur
and mythological scale that Tolkien carried off so well.

Behind them all - Tolkien, Lewis, and Wangerin - stands the great
tradition of English poets and storytellers. (Wangerin explicitly points
to Chaucer in his afterword.)

Many modern novelists seem to have forgotten that their predecessors who
truly excelled were nearly always lovers of the literature of the past.
If people today cannot muster the profundity or power of language that
Chesterton did, it is at least partly because they are not reading the
books he did. How many of us read any Chaucer at all in school? And how
many of us learned to love him, or John Donne, or Milton, or even
Shakespeare? Truly great writing is born of truly great reading.

This is one half of the slow death of truly wonderful - that is,
wonder-*inducing* - writing. Journalistic sensibilities have pushed
novelists toward the urgent, the *now*, and left behind the past, even
as they have murdered passionate prose in the name of brevity. Wangerin
deftly dodges this other half, too: he values the power and glory of
words as well as their utility.

Too many novelists treat words as nothing more than their meanings,
shorn of any hint of power - a notion that the book's plot rejects just
as firmly as Wangerin's prose does, and rightly so. When Hemingway and
others decried wordiness, it was not because they were opposed to length
itself length itself, or space given over for pure beauty. It was
precisely because they recognized the power of a word well chosen.
Equally, if every page is overflowing with words, they lose their
impact. But every really great writer is willing to stop at times and
simply let the beauty and power of language carry the book to heights
greater than the mere transfer of information. The difference between a
great writer and a merely good one, is this: the great one knows both
that words have beauty to revel in, and that too many words drown the
reader.

A final thought: <cite>The Book of the Dun Cow</cite> stirred my soul.
It reminded me that we fight evil outside us, but that we must fight
temptation and despair within just as fiercly. It reminded me that God's
ways are not mine. It reminded me that words have power and that choices
in the dark have consequences in the light. It did all this without
ever, ever preaching.

In his afterword, Wangerin spells out an aversion to allegory that
sounds much like a similar explanation penned by Tolkien a quarter
century earlier. Neither of them approved of stories that could be
reduced to meaning - as Wangerin puts it, "This means that." Many
Christian authors would be well served by Wangerin's pointed reminder:

> Should I, the author, ever state in uncertain terms what my book
> means, it would cease to be a living thing; it would cease to be the
> novel it might have been, and would rather become an illustration of
> some defining, delimiting concept. Sermons do that well and right
> properly. Novels in which the themes demand intellectual attention can
> only be novels in spite of these didactic interruptions.

He is absolutely right, of course. Sermonizing is appropriate in a
pulpit, but never in a novel. [<cite>The Book of the Dun Cow</cite>][]
was like a breath of fresh air after a week in Los Angeles - desperately
beautiful. Would that there were more such books. I commend it to you.
