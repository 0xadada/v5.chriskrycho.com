> If you want to find an instance of true gratitude for the infinite
> grace of God, do not go to those who think of God’s love as something
> that cost nothing, but go rather to those who in agony of soul have
> faced the awful fact of the guilt of sin, and then have come to know
> with a trembling wonder that the miracle of all miracles has been
> accomplished, and that the eternal Son has died in their stead.
