ChristianMingle.com's advertising... ugh. This, along with a smiling
couple, was the entirety of the content of one of their ads:

> Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your
> heart. â€”Psalm 37:4.

There are *so* many things wrong with this. So many that I don't even
have words for it, at least at the moment. (That, and I need to get out
the door if I'm going to finish my 13-mile run before dinner.) But there
will be words on this one. Oh, yes.
