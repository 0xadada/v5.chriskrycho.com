On the same topic I've been [hitting][] [a lot][] [recently][]:

> My pastor kindly asked me to read and review Bloodlines for him. His
> interest wasn’t merely in the book, rather he wanted to know how he
> could serve his congregants better, which I applaud and am most
> grateful for. Ever since reading Piper’s book I have been thinking
> about my experience at my local church and in my Christian walk. I
> have always been one of the few black females in my church, though I
> will say there are a growing number of young college females. The
> purpose of this article is to outline some of the thoughts I have had
> that I haven’t seen considered. I don’t presume to speak for all
> reformed black females but I do think these issues need to be
> addressed or at the least looked at by white pastors. I am black,
> female and reformed which makes me a bit of a “rare breed”.
