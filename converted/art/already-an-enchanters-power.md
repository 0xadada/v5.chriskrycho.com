> The mind that thought of light, heavy, grey, yellow, still, swift,
> also conceived of magic that would make heavy things light and able to
> fly, turn grey lead into yellow gold, and the still rock into a swift
> water...
>
> When we can take green from grass, blue from heaven, and red from
> blood, we have already an enchanter's powerâ€”upon one plane; and the
> desire to wield that power in the world external to our minds awakes.

---J. R. R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories"
