<div class="poem">
**6:38am**  
We crest a hill and the plain before  
Spreads vast and white

</p>
**6:48am**  
The land to either side is wrapped in  
Glorious shroud of purest heaven fall<!--more-->

**7:19am**  
A thin flame – the thinnest sliver  
of a flame –  
Orangely burns 'tween cloud and earth

**7:39am**  
A pearly halo hovers –  
traces lines –  
Between thick-drapéd eastern clouds

**7:47am**  
A radiant dome of blue and white!

**7:58am**  
A flight of overlapping, ever-shifting V's  
A dazzling wing of flapping wings  
A break in the monotony of gray-again sky

**10:36am**  
The sun, she palely glimmers,  
All but faint as the moon, through  
The heap of cloud that overtook her

**12:34am**  
Fleeing the fingers of the storm we  
all morning met,  
Now we make our course under a great  
empty field of purest azure

**3:13pm**  
The world wrapped in shadow and gloom again –  
We were caught or we caught the grey blank once more

<p>
**4:17pm**  
Sunset nighs, but first the bright dayqueen  
Sets the winter grass a verdant blaze  
One final glorious defiance against a day of cloud
