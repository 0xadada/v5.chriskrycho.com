Avid, the company that currently owns Sibelius, has decided to shut down
the main development office and outsource development to a much smaller
team in the Ukraine. You can read my general thoughts about the results
of selling small, successful companies to bigger ones [here][]:

> There’s a takeaway here for developers. If you care about your product
> at all – and I’m assuming you do, because if you’re just in it for the
> money, you’re probably not making the kind of product I buy anyway –
> then don’t sell. The moment you sell your company, no matter how good
> the sum, you’ve sold out. I’ve seen it happen too many times to
> believe otherwise.

[Don't Sell (Out)→][]

Today, I published [an open letter to the executives at Avid][],
imploring them to take the right step by their customers: sell the
product back to its inventors, Ben and Jonathan Finn, who have already
offered to buy it *twice*.

> Sell Sibelius. It is public knowledge that the Finn brothers have
> offered at least twice to purchase the software back from you, in the
> dual interests of maintaining the momentum of the software and of
> taking care of the employees you have let go. Selling it back to them
> is the right move – for your customers, for the product, for the
> developers, and most importantly, for Avid. The goodwill of your
> customer base and the trust of your own employees are not small things
> in the long run.

[Dear Avid: Please Sell Sibelius→][]

Will this - or any of the [similar efforts][] being made in the broader
Sibelius community - make a difference? The truth is, it's unlikely. But
it's worth a shot.
