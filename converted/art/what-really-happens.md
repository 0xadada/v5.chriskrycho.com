Slug: what-really-happens

> That state of mind has been called “willing suspension of disbelief.”
> But this does not seem to me a good description of what happens. What
> really happens is that the story-maker proves a successful
> “sub-creator.” He makes a Secondary World which your mind can enter.
> Inside it, what he relates is “true”: it accords with the laws of that
> world. You therefore believe it, while you are, as it were, inside.
> The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather
> art, has failed. You are then out in the Primary World again, looking
> at the little abortive Secondary World from outside.

---J. R. R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories"
