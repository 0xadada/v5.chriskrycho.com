In which [Jaimie Krycho][] kicks off a piece of [serial fantasy][]:

> She was standing on his shoulders. Literally.
>
> Sifani might have marveled at the strength and breadth of them, if
> Lorin wasn’t such a great buffoon. A beautiful buffoon, but a buffoon
> nonetheless. If he was aware of the fact he certainly didn’t care.
>
> He grunted beneath her weight and looked up at her from below, waiting
> until she looked back to make eyes at her legs. That was just to stoke
> her temper, Sifani reminded herself firmly. He did excel at that.
>
> “Do you see anything, my milk-tempered maiden?” Lorin asked sweetly.
>
> Sifani dug her heel into his shoulder bone for good measure.
