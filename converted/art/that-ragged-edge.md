I lost, somewhere along the way,  
that ragged edge that adds such  
vibrancy  
to the color of words spilt forth like  
so much black and white paint—  
gray—  
on canvas. No matter how precise,  
the strokes remain monochrome and  
dull  
and I wonder if my soul is still  
intact?—  
hidden out amongst the wild weeds  
brown  
with winter's death. Will I like  
they come once again—  
verdant—  
to life? Or will I wander always  
lost—no guide, no return to  
fervency  
in the way my fingers paint  
your mind with knowledge?
