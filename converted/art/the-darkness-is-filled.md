> You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in the
> land and in a river-valley; especially at times when two great
> thunderstorms meet and clash. More terrible still are thunder and
> lightning in the mountains at night, when storms come up from East and
> West and make war. The lightning splinters on the peaks, and rocks
> shiver, and great crashes split the air and go rolling and tumbling
> into every cave and hollow; and the darkness is filled with
> overwhelming noise and sudden light.

â€”J. R. R. Tolkien, <cite>The Hobbit</cite>
