> The rain never stopped.

> Sometimes it was no more than a chill mist sitting on the air; other
> times it came down suddenly, like an angry fist, and the Coop
> shuddered against it. The sky stood iron above. And the weird wind was
> ever out of the east.
>
> The trees lost their leaves, but there was no beauty in it this year,
> not any color but rot. It was as if they had simply given up to the
> moisture and the cold, and forgotten life. Nor was there any crackling
> of dry leaves, nor the sharp scent—clean and musty—of falling leaves,
> nor the blue bit of the year going out. Damp foliage was stripped from
> the trees by an everlasting rain. The naked trees shivered. That was
> all.

—Walter Wangerin Jr., <cite>The Book of the Dun Cow</cite>, p. 63

> The raining never stopped. From horizon to horizon, the clouds were
> locked in place, and the earth was shut up. An east wind—an odd wind
> to command the weather—brought this wetness and never stopped bringing
> it.
>
> But perhaps God looked down from his heaven and had pity upon the
> Coop, for a merciful change occurred in the rain. It became snow. And
> where water as rain was mere misery, the same water as snow was a soft
> delight: A hard freeze made the ground bony and firm; snow followed to
> whiten and to reveal the gentle contour of that ground; the cold air
> snapped life into the creatures who ventured forth to walk on it; the
> forest greeted them, tinkling and clinking as if its great trees had
> tiny voices—and more than any of that, the Coop became muffled in its
> warmth, because snow drifted up the outside of its walls.
