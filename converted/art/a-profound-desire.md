> I desired dragons with a profound desire. Of course, I in my timid
> body did not wish to have them in the neighborhood, intruding into my
> relatively safe world, in which it was, for instance, possible to read
> stories in peace of mind, free from fear. But the world that contained
> even the imagination of FÃ¡fnir was richer and more beautiful, at
> whatever cost of peril. The dweller in the quiet and fertile plains
> may hear of the tormented hills and the unharvested sea and long for
> them in his heart. For the heart is hard though the body be soft.

---J. R. R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories"
