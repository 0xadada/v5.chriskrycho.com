I nearly wept:  
my daughter could not understand  
why her body ached, rebelled,  
suffered from the stain of sin  
in sickness form  
-- sin she's yet to will --  
and my sorrow ran deeper than song:  
she has entered now into  
the pangs  
that make us hunger for  
eternity  
resurrection  
re-Incarnation  
<!--more-->  
I tasted then  
a hint  
-- one barest, infinitesimal hint --  
the pain of Bethlehem

</p>
I nearly wept:  
the God-son had always known  
why his body would ache, rebel  
suffer from the stain of sin  
in sickness form  
-- sin he never willed --  
and my trembling ran deeper than song:  
he entered then into  
our pangs  
and left behind  
eternity  
immortality  
un-Incarnation

God  
and humanity  
in hypostatic union  
neither  
twain and separate  
nor  
one subservient to other  
but  
perfect conjoination:  
divinized flesh and enfleshed deity  
mystery and paradox

impossibility

Why this myth come true?

For every infant child weeping wordless confusion at first illness  
For every mourning father, mother, brother, sister, friend of dead
child  
For every shattered marriage foundered on the rocks of selfish sin  
For every woman raped  
For every man abused from birth  
For every sick tragedy this world spews forth  
For sin  
For death

God with us  
among us  
like us  
for us
