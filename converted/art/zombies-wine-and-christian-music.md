[Güngör][] is really good. Great music, and getting better. The lead is
also a good thinker and writer. In a [blog post a few months ago][], he
really nailed contemporary Christian music to the wall. He wasn't harsh
or over the top, but he did say things that need to be said:

> Do you notice that nobody really uses that word [creativity] about
> other types of music? I just was perusing some Itunes user reviews to
> see if this holds up. I checked John Mark and mine, and “creativity”
> is very often found. But it’s not often found in reviews of bands like
> Sigur Ros, Bon Iver, Radiohead, Sufjan Stevens or other artists who
> are certainly very “creative.”
>
> Nobody goes to an art gallery and says, “boy, that painting is so
> creative.” Why? Because it’s art! Of course it’s creative! Why else
> would it be there? It’s very nature is creativity. Or like Lisa
> pointed out to me today, “that would be like saying, I love your
> house, it’s so architectural.”
>
> But when someone in the Christian industry actually takes their art
> seriously, everybody is like “holy crap, listen to how creative it
> is!”
>
> It’s like a person that’s been living among zombies for years seeing
> an actual human being and exclaiming, “wow, look at how clean her face
> is! She doesn’t even have any blood on it or anything!”
