Clay Shirky is a consistently solid thinker on media and policy. No
surprise, then, that [his thoughts][] on PIPA/SOPA (now [dead][],
thankfully) and the approach of the old media conglomerates in general:

> Traditional American media firms are implacably opposed to any
> increase in citizens’ ability to create, copy, save, alter, or share
> media on our own. They fought against cassette audio tapes, and
> photocopiers. They swore the VCR would destroy Hollywood. They tried
> to kill Tivo. They tried to kill MiniDisc. They tried to kill *player
> pianos*. They do this whenever a technology increases user freedom
> over media. Every time. Every single time.
