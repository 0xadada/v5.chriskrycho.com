> Nobody reads other people's code for fun. Hell, I don't even like

> evening of reading through someone else's code is absurd.

> But we need access to the source code. We must read other people's
> code because we have to understand it to get things done. So don't be
> afraid to read the source, Luke – and follow it wherever it takes you,
> no matter how scary looking that code is.
