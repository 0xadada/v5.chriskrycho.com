I have had the pleasure of designing a site for my lovely wife, [Jaimie
Krycho][], a really excellent writer in the midst of launching her
career. The site is about 90% there: it needs a couple more graphics
elements; it needs some responsive tweaks so it doesn't look ridiculous
on phones; it needs Retina graphics support. But it looks good and I'm
glad to have it up.

The back end is a WordPress theme built from the ground up to support
Jaimie's particular needs. The front end uses fonts from [Google
Fonts][], [Typekit][], and a free face using `@font-face`. The graphics
are all by yours truly. Take a look! (And maybe enjoy her ongoing serial
fiction while you're at it!
