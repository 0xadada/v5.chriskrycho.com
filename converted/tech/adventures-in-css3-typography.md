[Trent Walton][] is one of my favorite developer/designer types. In a
class he taught at a recent conference, he challenged people to make
good use of the best CSS3 and modern Javascript tools to reproduce movie
poster titling with nothing but web interface tools. You'll have to see
the results to believe them. My favorite? Toy Story. [New Adventures
