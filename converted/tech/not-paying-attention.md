> New research continues to emphasize the importance of mind wandering
> for learning. It turns out that *not* paying attention is one of the
> best ways of discovering new ideas. Reading books, whether silently or
> aloud, remains one of the most efficient means of enabling such errant
> thinking. As our bodies rest, our minds begin to work a different way.
> New connections, new pathways, and sharp turns are being made as we
> meander our way through the book, but also away from it. There is no
> way to tell if anyone is actually paying attention anymore as I read,
> including myself. This seems to be one of the great benefits of
> reading aloud, that you can think of something else while you do it.
> We may be holding the book together, but our minds are no doubt far
> apart by now.
