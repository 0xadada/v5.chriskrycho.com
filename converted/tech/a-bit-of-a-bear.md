Turns out that authentication can be a bit of a bear in web
applications... especially when you're dealing with two different
database backends, and all the more so when the functionality you're
adding on wasn't even a glimmer in someone's eye when they built the
first chunk of the application. I have a headache, thanks to this
particular implementation challenge.
