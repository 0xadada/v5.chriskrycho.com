A [fascinating story from Forbes][], on how one man has done the
seemingly impossible - built a successful independent bookstore in the
age of Amazon. (As a side note, I find I'm increasingly impressed by the
reporting coming out of Forbes. Perhaps they just hadn't been on my
radar, but in the last three months I've read a number of outstandingly
insightful pieces there on issues from this one on the Harvard Book
Store to several on <cite>Mass Effect 3</cite>.)

> A former technology executive with a passion for reading and books,
> Jeff saw – like everyone else – that the digitization of content was
> destroying the neighborhood bookstore.
>
> Imagine for a moment what it would feel like if people walked into
> your company and used the lobby to call your competitors and buy their
> products. That’s standard consumer behavior in a bookstore. People
> browse, find a book they like, pull out their smart phone, and order
> online.
>
> Making an intuitive leap, Jeff wondered if the opposite could be true?
