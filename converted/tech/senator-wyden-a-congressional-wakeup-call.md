It is even rarer for me to gush with praise for Democrat politicians
than for Republicans (rare enough already). But Senator Ron Wyden
(D-Oregon) deserves serious praise for being one of the few voices on
Capitol Hill who consistently opposed SOPA and PIPA on principle. [This
editorial][] at Wired is yet another example of his being right on
target:

> While some have derided the events of last week as a departure from
> the way we do things in Washington, I believe last week is an example
> of the way Washington can change for the better. If more Americans
> took the time to be informed and call Congress when something matters
> to them lobbyist and special interest power would be greatly
> diminished.
>
> So the question is, did Congress learn anything? Will Washington
> lament last week like it was a bad review that cost it business or
> will it recognize what happened as an opportunity to learn and do
> better?
