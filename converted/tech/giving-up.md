I finally gave up on my work laptop's default keyboard and brought my
low-profile Apple keyboard from home. So much happier this way.
Seriously: I can't even type correctly on the HP Compaq keyboard, the
response is so mushy. I end up capitalizing the second letter of each
capitalized word almost without exception. This is simply not a problem
on any quality keyboard. If you want to know the differences between a
cheap laptop and a good laptop, this is one of the big ones. Right up
there with trackpad quality (and size!), and whether the edged of
computer attempt to kill you by slitting your wrists. Ugh.
