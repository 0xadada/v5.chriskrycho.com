I can hardly wait to invest in a new computer. Though my current machine
has served me well these past five years - and though it is still in
many ways superior to even a number of newer alternatives - I am looking
forward enormously to the upgrade. Five years later, I will be doubling
my computing cores (with faster cores, to boot), octupling my RAM (with
higher throughput), quadrupling my total storage, and adding an SSD with
all the speed improvements *that* promises.

In short, I'll be flying. It's going to be *fun* to push the machine and
see just how far it will go and still perform well.
