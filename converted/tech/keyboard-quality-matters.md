I spent much of the day today working on a slightly older model HP
Compac laptop.

To be as plain as I can: the keyboard was utterly atrocious. To say the
keys are mushy is an understatement. To say the designers lacked a sense
of aesthetic pleasure would only be slightly less obvious than to say
that they had no concept of the value of ergonomics.<!--more-->

When I returned home and started typing on my 2007-era Macbook Pro, I
experienced an immediate (although not immediately conscious) sense of
tactile pleasure. Within a very brief time, the consciousness of this
pleasure had risen to the forefront of my mind - the experience of
typing was no longer a source of frustration, and this was a *notable*
difference from my experience earlier in the day.

Keyboard quality matters. There is a reason Apple products continue to
sell well, and it is not (as so many have intimated) some cultish
phenomenon. Rather, the phenomenon is a response to well-designed
machines that put the user's experience at the forefront.

There is a lesson here for all designers, including web designers. It is
possible that people will not consciously notice if we do our jobs
badly. It is even possible that they will not consciously notice if we
do our jobs well. However, the reality is that the pleasure inherent in
using something well-designed and well-crafted *does* make a difference
in our productivity.

Pleasure, as it turns out, is not an incidental component of good
design. It is essential.
