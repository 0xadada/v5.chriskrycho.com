I recently started using [Bitbucket][] for just about all my software
repositories. I like [GitHub][], too, but Bitbucket has support for both
Mercurial and Git, and I prefer the former (even if the latter has a bit
broader usage in the software community).

You can find my public project(s) [at Bitbucket itself][] or
(identically) on a CNAME mirror of the site [here at chriskrycho.com][]
- a lovely feature that both GitHub and Bitbucket support.

One software development effort I’m involved with is actually testing
Bitbucket for all its source repositories. If you’re on a small team,
it’s a *very* good resource, as it you can have unlimited repositories
for free if you have five or fewer people on the team, and for \$10 a
month for 10 people on the team. If your team is large enough that you
can have a dedicated IP person, it’s probably less effective - but it’s
hard to beat that for small teams without a dedicated IT employee.
