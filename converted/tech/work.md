Here are an assortment of the many sites I have designed â€“ some of them
built from scratch, others using existing frameworks.

From scratch
------------

-   [JaimieKrycho.com][] - the home of Jaimie Krycho's writing career
-   [Independent Clauses][] - the independent music blog of Stephen
    Carradini
-   [The Invited Birth][] - the professional website for Michelle Roper,
    a doula in Richmond, Virginia

Rejiggered themes
-----------------

-   [Swoon Designs][] - the home of Sarah Warren's custom invitations,
    personal stationery, and branding business. We designed the site
    together, and built it as a child theme on the [Reason 2.0][]
    template.
-   [The Accidental Okie][] - Sarah Warren's personal blog, a customized
    version of the [Simply Luxe][] theme.
-   [Gospelized][] - the art blog of [Stephen Carradini][], with a few
    subtle tweaks to color and typography from the original "Clear"
    theme (no longer accessible).

Historically meaningful
-----------------------

-   [Adopted by the King][] - template customizations and header image
    design for a friend's blog.
-   [52 Verses][] - a poetry blog I maintained (for not quite long
    enough).
-   [Pillar on the Rock][] - a group blog on church practice that I edit
    and to which I contribute. Custom Blogger template, built from
    scratch.
-   [Thoughts; A Flame][] - my 2005-2010 era blog, ultimately replaced
    by this very site.
-   [chriskrycho.com [2010]][] - my landing page throughout 2010.
