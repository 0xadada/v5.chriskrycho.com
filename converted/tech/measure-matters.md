The more time I spend reading things on the internet, the more obvious
it is to me that [measure matters][]. Too many sites still have lines
running to well over 100 characters. (I saw one recently that runs to
135, and many online technical manuals still run to the full width of
the page!) It's just hard to read.

I locked this site in at between 66 and 72 characters, and it makes a
difference. I hope, eventually, that *everyone* gets this right. In the
meantime, [Instapaper][] and [Readability][] carry the day!
