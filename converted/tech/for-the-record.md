For the record, last week was an extremely unusual week in terms of
posting frequency. Between launching the site and the unusually
provocative points for [discussion][] prompted by PIPA/SOPA, there was a
lot of extra content last. I generally hope to have around one post a
day up on *one* of the sections of this site, so each section will get a
post only every three or four days on average.
