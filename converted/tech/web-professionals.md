Everything I know about web design and development, I learned from the
largesse of those who have shared their own knowledge along the way.
These are some of the best. (If they don't write often, it's because
they're too busy changing the web.)

### Design

-   [A List Apart][] - *pushing the web in the right direction one issue
    at a time for over a decade.*
-   [Andy Mangold][] - *I only just discovered him, but I'm a fan of
    where he's going.*
-   [CSS Wizardry][] - *I normally loathe tips-and-tricks sites. Harry
    Roberts' site is *the* exception.*
-   [Jason Santa Maria][] - *a designer whose work I admire immensely.*
-   [Mark Boulton][] - *a Welsh fellow intent on betting web design
    practice and standards.*
-   [Simple Bits][] - *Dan Cederholm does some really elegant visual
    design work.*
-   [Unstoppable Robot Ninja][] - *Ethan Marcotte is one of the real
    luminaries of web design, always advancing best practices.*

<div class="column right donthyphenate">
### Development

-   [John Dyer's Code][] - *works for a seminary, wrote a book on media
    ecology, and makes things like [MediaElement.js][]. Impressive.*
-   [O'Reilly Radar][] - *the daily
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Four short links</span>
    posts are worth their weight in gold.*
-   [Perishable Press][] - *Jeff Starr on Javascript, PHP, CSS, Apache
    and Wordpress. Fantastically helpful.*
-   [Trent Walton][] - *makes Javascript do amazing and wonderful
    things.*
-   [The Grid System][] - *exactly what it says on the label.*

### Typography

-   [I Love Typography][] - *a phrase I've said aloud several times
    since I started reading this site.*
-   [nicetype][] - *a blog about fonts, typography, and graphic design.*
