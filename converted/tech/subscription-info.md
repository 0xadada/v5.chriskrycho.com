A few people have let me know that they would like to get all of my
feeds - not having to subscribe separately to each blog. Gladly for you,
I thought of this eventuality; you can use the [subscription links][] at
the bottom of the [main page][] - then you will get a combined feed of
all of my blogs in one.

I hope at some point in the future to set up a system that lets you
subscribe easily to whichever of the feeds you like - at the moment I
only have individual feeds for the sites or a globally unified feed.
Eventually, I want to set up the feed subscriptions so that you can just
check a box for the blogs you want to follow, which will then deliver
those as a single combined feed for your convenience. Alas, I'm pretty
well swamped at the moment, so it'll be a while before I get there.
