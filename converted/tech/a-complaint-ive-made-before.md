Writing over at No Segue:

> I want to use Google+. I really do. The UI is far better than that of
> Facebook; there are a lot of advantages in the conversation model over
> either Facebook or Twitter; and the overall approach is just one I
> like better.

> There’s just one hiccup—one I’ve written about before: I can’t get it
> into my workflow.
