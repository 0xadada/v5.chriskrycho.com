I read Jeff Atwood's blog regularly. He's a great developer, has some
great insights into technology, and he's an interesting writer. Of
everything I've seen of his, though, I think [this post][] of his
yesterday is the most important he's ever written.

He's right. Too many business and engineering types - especially men -
think they'll find lasting satisfaction in their jobs. Too many answers
to deathbed questions point the other way, though. No one ever says, "I
wish I had worked more and spent less time with my family."
