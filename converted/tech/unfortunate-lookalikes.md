One of my great pet peeves with Arial is the relationship between 'r'
and 'n' when set next to each other. If one compares
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 0.75em;">rn</span> and
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 0.75em;">m</span>, they're
nearly identical. The kerning is off, and the letters designed too
similarly.

My mind glitches every time I see them in writing - particularly when
the alternative is nonsensical or bizarrely out of place, as in the
common abbreviation of postmodern as 'pomo', which has the unfortunate
lookalike of 'porno' in Arial. Certainly not the sort of mistake one
wishes one's readers to make.

Typography matters.
