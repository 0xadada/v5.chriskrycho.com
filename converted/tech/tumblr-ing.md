I'm now tumblr-ing at [nosegue.tumblr.com][]. I may move that to
`chriskrycho.com/web/nosegue` or `nosegue.chriskrycho.com` at some
point; we'll see. For the moment, I just want something quick and easy
for lots of miscellaneous-ish things that don't fit in any of these four
major blogs. Also, to experiment with **tumblr**. (Also: to have an
excuse to play with fonts for fifteen minutes when I should have been
[figuring out how to convert handwriting to SVG or PNG][] for a website
I'm working on.)
