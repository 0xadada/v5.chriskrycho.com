We've been here almost two weeks; I've finished my first week of working
part time and doing school part time. Next up? Getting back in the swing
of writing. I'm hoping to jump back in tomorrow - get a real post here
up, maybe knock out the rest of one I'm writing for Mere Orthodoxy, dip
my toes back into the water at Ars Artis or Ardent Fidelity, and most
definitely get back into working on the book I have coming out later
this year.

What's that you say? Keep your ears peeled. More news to come.
