The folks reading this blog may or may not know how Jaimie and I have
walked through her struggle with clinical depression over the last three
and a half years. You can find some of our story, and - more importantly
- some of the huge lessons I learned about walking through a spouse's
depression in this new post at "Ardent
Fidelity":http://www.chriskrycho.com/theology/posts/marriage-depression/:

bq.. You are not the hero of this story. Jesus is. The sooner you get
that, the sooner you'll have any chance at all of really helping your
spouse in this time.

The hard reality - and the good reality - is that, much as we want to,
we cannot fix our spouse's depression. No words, no encouragement, no
number of chores taken up on their behalf will do the trick. There is no
switch to flip, no magic incantation to take away the darkness. That
doesn't make those things meaningless. Your spouse needs every bit of
help you can give. But operate with no illusions: you will not make your
husband or wife better with those actions.

This is freeing, really. You can simply do your best every moment, and
trust that God is bigger and greater and capable of doing all you cannot
do. You can't carry her; don't try. Do what you can do.
