If you're friends with me, you should be friends with my friends.
They're substantially more interesting, funny, and generally cool than I
am.

-   [Refining Process][] – my amazing wife Jaimie, on living life for
    Christ's glory.
-   [Adopted by the King][] – PJ and Katie King: young Texans passionate
    about adoption, Christ, and his church.
-   [Britt and Lauren][] – college friends now serving at a campus
    parachurch ministry.
-   [Laura Meador][] – she doesn't write often, but when she does, it's
    wonderful.
-   [The Miseducation of Abigail Herring][] – a funny girl with some
    thoughts on life, love, God, and the element of surprise.
-   [our life on the plains][] – Jenni Stringham (a friend from Focus
    Leadership Institute) on life with her husband and baby boy
-   [A Passionate Pursuit][] - my sister, Abi, on nearly as many topics
    as *I* write on. (That's quite the feat!)
-   [PJKing.net][] - my good friend PJ King with life updates from his
    own perspective.
-   [Stephen Carradini: Writing Words, Making Music][] - Stephen
    Carradini is a good friend, a good writer, a good musician, and
    sometimes hilarious.
-   [the traveling russells][] – Chase and Julie Russell, the couple who
    really made us a *part* of our current church, serving as
    missionaries in Nicaragua.
