Regular readers of this blog who don't necessarily make their way over
to my theology blog may be interested in "my
review":http://www.chriskrycho.com/theology/articles/reviews/shepherding-a-childs-heart/
of Tedd Tripp's "??Shepherding A Child's
Heart??":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0966378601/ref=as\_li\_ss\_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ardent-fidelity-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0966378601.
From my conclusion:

bq. Shepherding a Child's Heart is thus a very strange mix of very good
and just plain bad. I can't recommend it wholeheartedly by any means;
neither can I dismiss it out of hand. There is a lot of good in Tripp's
parenting philosophy, and some very good material in his applications of
that philosophy, especially as it relates to communication. But there is
equally bad material in some of his application, and unnecessarily so.
Were Tripp to be a bit more self-consistent, he would have a much better
book.
