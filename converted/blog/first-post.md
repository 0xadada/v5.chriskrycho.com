It is with considerable delight that I kick off this family blog. I've
never really had a need for one before - Jaimie and I have been living
fairly simple lives, easy enough to keep people up to date on.

All of that is going to change in the near future, though. Here are the
things on our plate in the next 8 months:<!--more-->

-   The birth of our first child, a little girl (who I am praying looks
    much more like Jaimie than like me)!
-   A move to North Carolina so I can begin studying at Southeastern
    Baptist Theological Seminary.
-   An accompanying change in jobs.
-   An accompanying change in churches - we've been at our current
    church for the last four years.

These changes will mostly be bittersweet: we'll be glad to get out of
Oklahoma (where I've spent my last six and a half years), but sad to say
goodbye to our friends here; we'll be glad to be attending seminary, but
feel a bit of trepidation at the enormity of the change ahead; I'll be
glad to start a new vocation, but know it will be enormously more
challenging in many ways.

In addition, we're moving far enough that we'll no longer see Jaimie's
family more than about once a year. That's going to be a significant
transition, as we've never lived more than about 3 hours away from them.
That's still plenty of time to make weekend trips down to visit tiring
but doable. Similarly, my own hometown of Colorado Springs has been a
drivable distance away if we're going to be in town for a few days: it's
just one long day of driving each way. North Carolina is a different
matter entirely. It's a solid three day drive to visit either side of
the family.

I said *mostly* bittersweet, because the birth of our daughter will be
nothing but sweet, God willing! I look forward to sharing pictures of
Jaimie's growing belly, and especially of pictures of our baby girl when
she is born. I can't begin to express how excited I am, and as well how
much trepidation I feel at the responsibility of raising a young woman
to walk with God. I have to regularly remind myself - yes, even now,
four and a half months before the due date - that the most important
things I can do are pray and walk with God myself and trust him.

Though a sweet change, that change will bring its own challenges, too.
Our schedule will never be the same; our *lives* will never be the same.
(For the record, that's a good thing and something we're only excited
about.) Most of all, neither of us have ever been parents before, so we
are going to have a *lot* of learning to do.

I've no doubt we'll navigate the transition, and I've no doubt there is
a great deal of joy ahead. I have seen the faithfulness of God over all
my life, and am confident of his goodness on the road ahead. I simply
know that it will be interesting and *very* different from our current
phase of life.

I hope you all enjoy joining us on our adventure. I hope to keep this
blog fairly up to date, posting at least twice a month, and over time
Jaimie may post as well. Here's looking forward to the adventure ahead!
