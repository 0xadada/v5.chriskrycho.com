Chris is in his mid-twenties, working as a software developer and
pursuing a Masters of Divinity at Southeastern Theological Seminary. He
grew up in Colorado Springs, then attended the University of Oklahoma,
where he studied physics (and music composition, but they don't offer
music minors). He likes running, reading, playing Ultimate, and spending
time with friends when he's not busy with one of the many things he
writes about on this site.

Jaimie is a Texan by birth, a writer by trade, and a happily expecting
mommy. She maintains her own personal blog, [Refining Process][], which
is funnier and better-written than this one, as well as a professional
blog at [JaimieKrycho.com][], which is more awesome and interesting than
this one. She excels at meeting and making friends with non-Americans,
is a wonder with small children, makes some mean tacos, sings in every
style imaginable, and is drop-dead gorgeous.

Chris and Jaimie share a love of videogames (from <cite>Halo</cite> to
<cite>Skyrim</cite>) and are enormous fans of <cite>Castle</cite> and
<cite>Doctor Who</cite>.

Perhaps most exciting, they are are giddily enjoying the extraordinary
adventure and changes that come with their first child, a beautiful
little girl named Elayne Kaylee.

In the meantime, they're soon-to-be members of First Baptist Church of
Durham, where they're looking forward to serving and growing as long as
they're in the area.
