Tonight, Elayne (whom we have taken to calling "Ellie Kay") decided she
was going to be fussy. Unless I was "dancing" with her. I had "The Piano
Guys":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09RUuTAM2H0 playing, and if I held
her in my lap or the crook of my arm, she fussed... but if I held her up
in front of me, gently bouncing her back and forth in time to the music,
she quieted down and got the closest thing to a smile a 3-week old can
do.

She looked as happy as can be, and my heart melted. Jaimie, through a
closed door and with the shower running, could nonetheless hear me
exclaiming about how cute our little girl is. It's hard not to exclaim,
when she just looks perfectly content and happy as long as I'm dancing
with her.

Let's keep dancing together, Ellie Kay.
