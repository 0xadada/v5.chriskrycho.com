I just felt baby girl kicking and moving around for the first time!

It is one of the coolest, strangest, most awesome, most mind-boggling
things I have ever felt. There is a little person in there, growing -
now big enough that when she moves and pushes or kicks against the womb,
I can *feel* it.<!--more-->

In a few months, she'll be so big that we'll be *seeing* it when she's
stretching and kicking.

A few months after *that*, we'll be holding her.

The thought awes me, and it has brought me near to tears a few times
already. There is already a sense of responsibility and weight and
fearful expectation. I am going to be this little girl's father, her
first picture of a father.

I have seen, in many people's lives, how their relationship with their
father informs their understanding of God. That is as it should be: God
created the human relationship of father to child as a model of our
relationship to him, just as marriage is a picture of Christ and the
church.

If we are not struck by the responsibility we have to present him well -
as faithful husbands and gracious, loving fathers - we do not understand
what marriage and fatherhood are at their core very well at all.

Every time I get a better sense of what marriage *means*, and now as I
first begin to grasp what being a father *means*, I understand the
weight that God has put on my shoulders and I am driven back to him.
There is no way I can do this as I should on my own, no way that in my
own understanding and wisdom I can present God as he is.

Yet the Spirit gives grace, and Christ has united us to him, and the
Father himself loves us. Praise God that our hope is not in our own
strength, but in Christ who has become our [wisdom][] as well as our
righteousness.
