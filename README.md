Here I version control my website. At present, that simply means the WordPress
theme files. In the future, it will include content -- I'll pull in the
repository containing the various historical pieces, if I decide to integrate
them into the new version of the site. (Otherwise, I'll just end up adding a fun
little redirect to my `.htaccess` file, I suppose.)
