# v4.chriskrycho.com

The fifth (I'm a programmer, so I started counting at 0) iteration of my website! Launching probably in early 2019; feel free to follow along in the meantime. It's built on [Gutenberg], at least for now.

Previous versions:

- [v3.chriskrycho.com][v3]—a statically-generated site built in [Pelican], from 2014–2018.
- [v2.chriskrycho.com][v2]—a family of [WordPress] sites, where I ran my various blogging from 2012–2013.
- [v1.chriskrycho.com][v1]—a simple site that I used as a portfolio and for some experimentation in 2011.
- [v0.chriskrycho.com][v0]—my Blogger blog as it was from 2006–2011, originally at `blog.chriskrycho.com`, but I decided I wanted that domain available to redirect to whatever is my current *blog* site.
