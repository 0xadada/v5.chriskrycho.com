[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/15dd2381-bb68-4e1e-94d7-38a0b7d6d2fb/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/v5-chriskrycho-com/deploys)

The fifth iteration of my website! Launching sometime in 2019; feel free to follow along in the meantime. I'm building it on [Eleventy] for its ease of configuration and supporting much/all of what I need. (I still have dreams of building a site generator in Rust that's equally flexible and way faster; keep your eyes on this site after it launches for news on that front, someday, hopefully!)

- [v2.chriskrycho.com][v2]—a simple site that I used as a portfolio and for some experimentation in 2011.
