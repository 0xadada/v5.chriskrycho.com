                <title>A Meander</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a meander. I have a bunch of mostly-unformed thoughts, and I want to write, and the two come out here, together, in the next few minutes before I start my workday proper (because I stayed up late last night working on open source software and got up late accordingly, and so have a great deal less of &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chriskrycho.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;knowing-your-rhythms.html&quot; title=&quot;“Knowing Your Rhythms”&quot;&gt;my normally-allocated writing time&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; available today).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-source software is a very strange place, and the dynamics of it favor those of us who already have well-paying jobs and lots of flexibility in our schedule.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a bad thing. It means that anyone who wants to use open-source contribution as a gauge of someone’s fitness to work is making a pretty foolish decision, though: they’re inherently cutting off a whole sector---dare I say it, a whole &lt;em&gt;class&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;---of people who simply do not (and, barring being given a pretty surprising break, will never) have that kind of stability and flexibility.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; bad for meaningful discussion. I follow both &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;noahpinion&quot;&gt;Noah Smith (@noahpinion)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;lymanstoneky&quot;&gt;Lyman Stone (@lymanstoneky)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and they’re both extremely interesting follows, and they’re both clearly &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; smart and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; well-informed, and in their off-Twitter writing they both do a good job of fairly representing others’ views and interacting with them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, their arguments are a disaster.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not specific to Smith and Stone. This is Twitter in one pair of interlocutors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously: stop tweeting and start blogging again, if you have an &lt;em&gt;argument&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to make rather than just a pithy, one-off observation or a link to share.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get a surprising amount of writing done in 5 minutes, if you’re willing to just word-vomit. (This whole post, start to finish, took me 12 minutes.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;4.&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to read more poetry; more rich, good fiction; more rich, good nonfiction. I’ve read a lot of nonfiction in the last five years, but I wouldn’t call most of it &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Most of it---most of my seminary reading, that is---was &lt;em&gt;just okay&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; very little of it engaged deeply with thought critical of its own perspective. (Major exceptions: David Koyzis’ really excellent &lt;em&gt;Political Visions and Illusions&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, Alvin Plantinga’s &lt;em&gt;Where the Conflict Really Lies&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and of course St. Athanasius’ &lt;em&gt;On the Incarnation&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I find that my own writing is far sharper, clearer, and better when I’m drawing &lt;em&gt;widely&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and from &lt;em&gt;deep wells&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Widely, because I find that too much time in the same spot overly narrows my focus, whether that is apologetics or programming languages. From deep wells because, frankly, there is too much out there which warrants nothing more than a skim &lt;em&gt;at most&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is all!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

                <guid>v4.chriskrycho.com/book-list/</guid>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve just posted my in-progress &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chriskrycho.com&#x2F;2017-book-list.html&quot;&gt;2017 Book List&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I&#x27;ll update it with books as I finish them, and I&#x27;ll also update it with reviews (even of the &amp;quot;here&#x27;s a brief comment&amp;quot; variety) as I do them. This is something I&#x27;ve been thinking about doing for my own sake for a while, and bumping into &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tbrown.org&#x2F;notes&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;23&#x2F;reading-and-sharing&#x2F;&quot;&gt;this post by Tim Brown&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; reminded me how much I want to be sharing what I read with other people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get myself spun up on thinking that I need to be reviewing books with the best of them. In reality, I really just want to do like Tim says in that post (emphasis his):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am reading and sharing ideas about what I have read, I feel like my best self. &lt;em&gt;I want more of that feeling.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;... I’m wondering if acknowledging what I read, along with a substantial visual (a book cover image?) and any highlights or notes, could feel just as good as having a physical book.... Maybe I could list my piles of books here on my website, and link them to blog post entries with highlights&#x2F;notes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s it exactly. So I&#x27;m going ahead and doing the work: I&#x27;m going to keep that list up to date, and I&#x27;m going to try to write and share &lt;em&gt;something&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; about every book I read for the rest of the year. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a lot---just a sentence or two will do in many cases. &amp;quot;I liked it&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;This had a lot of potential but didn&#x27;t quite measure up to it.&amp;quot; Something simple like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wynnnetherland.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;to-hell-and-back-europe-1914-1949&#x2F;&quot;&gt;what Wynn Netherland does&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, or something long and careful when it makes good sense.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someday I&#x27;ll be able to write one of those killer reviews that ends up changing a whole conversation, or maybe I&#x27;ll just have a bunch of interesting notes I can look back on later and be able to see what I thought about a book when I&#x27;m curious a decade later. Either way, I think it&#x27;ll be a nice win.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chriskrycho.com&#x2F;2017-book-list.html&quot;&gt;book list&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
