Title: The Cost of Civil Religion
Status: draft

One cost of our civil religion is its ever-present pseudo-Christian civic theism, with its notion that being a good American who likes God and lives a basically moral life is what it *is* to be a Christian. I have seen this often in my own circles of acquaintance. The more we can get away from this sort of civic moralism, the better we will be.
