In the latter parts of 2013 and the first week of 2014, I read Harry Potter again for only the second time, and for the first time in about five years. I had read the series back in the fall of 2008, one after another,[^1] then slowly watched my way through the movies with Jaimie. After that, I had moved on, content finally to have read what everyone was raving about---and not, in truth, overly impressed for the most part.

[^1]:	If you want to know, I read them all in the span of about 70 hours. That is, in point of fact, somewhat ridiculous.
